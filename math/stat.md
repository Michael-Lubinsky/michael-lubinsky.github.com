## How to test whether two variables have a monotonic relationship 
meaning they tend to increase or decrease together, 
without necessarily being linearly related ‚Äî 
the most appropriate statistical test is:

### Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
 Spearman's rank correlation  measures the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship between two variables.

It‚Äôs non-parametric (does not assume a specific distribution).

It‚Äôs based on ranked values, not raw data ‚Äî so it captures monotonic trends, even if nonlinear.

üß™ Hypothesis tested:
H‚ÇÄ (null hypothesis): The variables are not monotonically related.

H‚ÇÅ (alternative): There is a monotonic relationship.

‚úÖ Use Spearman when:
You want to test for monotonic association, not just linear (like Pearson does).

Your data may have nonlinear but ordered trends.  
Your variables are ordinal, or not normally distributed.  
Example in Python:  
```python

from scipy.stats import spearmanr
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

corr, p_value = spearmanr(x, y)
print(f"Spearman correlation: {corr:.3f}, p-value: {p_value:.3f}")
```

### Mann-Kendall trend test and Kendall's Tau correlation test 

They are related but distinct.
‚úÖ Kendall's Tau:
A correlation coefficient that measures the strength of monotonic association between two variables.

It gives a value between -1 and 1 like Spearman‚Äôs rho or Pearson‚Äôs r.  
Typically used to assess how well one variable monotonically relates to another.  

‚û°Ô∏è Example use:

"Is there a monotonic relationship between income and education level?"

‚úÖ Mann-Kendall Trend Test:
A non-parametric test specifically designed to detect monotonic trends over time in a single variable.

Used in time series analysis to determine whether a variable tends to increase or decrease over time.

It also uses a statistic derived from Kendall‚Äôs rank correlation, but it is applied over time, not between two variables.

‚û°Ô∏è Example use:

"Is temperature showing a consistent upward or downward trend over the past 50 years?"

| Feature  | Kendall's Tau           | Mann-Kendall Trend Test     |
| -------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Purpose  | Measure correlation     | Detect trend in time series |
| Data     | Two variables           | One variable over time      |
| Output   | Correlation coefficient | Trend direction + p-value   |
| Use case | Association strength    | Trend detection             |



pip install pymannkendall

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import kendalltau
import pymannkendall as mk

# Create synthetic time series data with a trend
np.random.seed(42)
time = np.arange(2000, 2020)
values = np.linspace(10, 20, len(time)) + np.random.normal(0, 1, len(time))

# 1. Kendall's Tau Correlation
tau_corr, tau_p = kendalltau(time, values)
print(f"Kendall's Tau correlation: {tau_corr:.3f}, p-value: {tau_p:.3f}")

# 2. Mann-Kendall Trend Test
mk_result = mk.original_test(values)
print(f"\nMann-Kendall Test:")
print(f"  Trend: {mk_result.trend}")
print(f"  Tau: {mk_result.Tau:.3f}")
print(f"  S: {mk_result.S}")
print(f"  p-value: {mk_result.p:.3f}")
print(f"  h (significant?): {mk_result.h}")

# Plot
plt.plot(time, values, marker='o')
plt.title('Synthetic Time Series with Trend')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

Kendall‚Äôs Tau is another non-parametric test for monotonicity, 
often more robust in small datasets or with many tied ranks.
