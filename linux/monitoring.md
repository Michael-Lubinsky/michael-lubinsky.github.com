## Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics

- **VictoriaMetrics is designed to be a drop-in replacement or long-term storage backend for Prometheus.**
- **They can be used together**: Prometheus scrapes metrics and pushes them to VictoriaMetrics (via remote write).
- **VictoriaMetrics supports the Prometheus query language (PromQL)** and many of its APIs.

### Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics Key Differences and Features

| Feature                     | Prometheus                          | VictoriaMetrics                          |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Role**           | Time-series database + scraper      | Time-series database only                 |
| **Data Ingestion**         | Pull-based (scrapes targets)        | Push-based (via Prometheus remote write) |
| **Storage Duration**       | Short-term (days to weeks)          | Long-term (months to years)              |
| **Scalability**            | Limited (single-node)               | Highly scalable (single-node or cluster) |
| **Performance**            | Optimized for simplicity            | Optimized for ingestion & query speed     |
| **Use Case Together**      | Prometheus scrapes, Victoria stores | VictoriaMetrics stores & queries metrics |

---

## ðŸ§© Typical Setup Using Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics

1. Prometheus scrapes targets and stores recent metrics locally.
2. Prometheus uses **`remote_write`** to push metrics to **VictoriaMetrics** for long-term retention.
3. Grafana queries VictoriaMetrics using PromQL for dashboards.

## âœ… VictoriaMetrics Advantages Over Prometheus (for storage)

- More efficient storage and lower disk usage.
- Better performance at scale (high cardinality/time range).
- Built-in compaction and downsampling.
- Supports clustering for high availability.

---

**In summary**:  
VictoriaMetrics is **not a fork** of Prometheus but rather a **complementary time-series database** that can integrate with Prometheus to provide **better scalability, performance, and long-term storage**.




### OpenTelemetry [OTel] 


- **OpenTelemetry** (OTel) is a **vendor-neutral** framework for collecting **telemetry data**: 
  - **Metrics**
  - **Logs**
  - **Traces**

- It is a unified standard backed by the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)   
  to **instrument applications** and **export observability data**.

---

### ðŸ”„ OTel Integration with Prometheus and Grafana

### ðŸ“Š Metrics â†’ Prometheus

- **OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collector** can **export metrics in Prometheus format**.
- Prometheus can **scrape metrics** exposed by OpenTelemetry-instrumented applications.
- Alternatively, **OpenTelemetry Collector** can expose a **Prometheus scrape endpoint**.

### ðŸ“ˆ Visualization â†’ Grafana

- **Grafana** is a **visualization layer**.
- Grafana can:
  - Read **Prometheus metrics** (scraped from OpenTelemetry).
  - Query **traces** from backends like **Jaeger** or **Tempo** (also exported by OpenTelemetry).
  - Display **logs** if exported to systems like **Loki**.

---

### ðŸ§© Typical Pipeline

```
Application (instrumented with OpenTelemetry SDK)
         â†“
OpenTelemetry Collector
         â†“
Exporters:
  - Prometheus metrics â†’ scraped by Prometheus â†’ visualized in Grafana
  - Traces â†’ Jaeger / Tempo â†’ visualized in Grafana
  - Logs â†’ Loki â†’ visualized in Grafana
```

---

### âœ… Summary

| Component        | Role                                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **OpenTelemetry** | Collects telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces) |
| **Prometheus**    | Scrapes metrics from OpenTelemetry or apps     |
| **Grafana**       | Visualizes data from Prometheus, Jaeger, Loki, etc. |

---

**In essence**:  
OpenTelemetry **generates and exports** observability data.  
Prometheus **stores metrics**, and Grafana **visualizes them all** (metrics, logs, traces).
