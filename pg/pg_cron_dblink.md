### pg_cron extension

 You cannot use pg_cron in 2 databases. 
 pg_cron runs a single background worker.  

That worker reads jobs only from the database you configure in postgresql.conf as:

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_cron'
cron.database_name = 'weavix'
```
cron.database_name setting is not present by default in postgresql.conf.   
You need to manually add it if you want to use pg_cron with a database other than postgres

you cannot run a query from one database that references another.

If you must keep pg_cron in the postgres DB but want to run queries in weavix, 
use the dblink extension.

1. Enable dblink:
In postgres database:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION dblink;
```
2. Use it inside pg_cron jobs:
```sql
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'daily_weavix_job',
  '0 1 * * *',
  $$
  SELECT * FROM dblink('dbname=weavix',
    'INSERT INTO silver.daily_counts SELECT ... FROM bronze.events ...'
  ) AS t(dummy int);
  $$
);
```
⚠️ But this requires:

- weavix allows TCP connections from localhost  
- Authentication is correctly set up in .pgpass or via pg_hba.conf



### pg_cron.schedule_in_database()
Modern versions of pg_cron (v1.4 and above, which is highly likely for PostgreSQL 16)  
include a function specifically for this: cron.schedule_in_database().   
This function is designed to handle scheduling jobs in databases other than the one where pg_cron itself is installed.   
It simplifies the process significantly because pg_cron handles the internal connection to the target database.

```sql
SELECT cron.schedule_in_database(
    job_name TEXT,
    schedule TEXT,
    command TEXT,
    database_name TEXT,
    username TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
    active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```
Example:

If pg_cron is in Database A and you want to run CALL my_procedure_in_db_b() in Database B:  
Run this from Database A (where pg_cron is installed)

```sql

SELECT cron.schedule_in_database(
    'daily_procedure_b',
    '0 3 * * *', -- Run daily at 3:00 AM
    'CALL my_procedure_in_db_b();',
    'DatabaseB', -- The name of the target database
    'your_user_for_db_b' -- User with permissions in DatabaseB
);
```
Why pg_cron.schedule_in_database() is preferred (if available):

Native Integration:   
It's the most direct and intended way to schedule jobs across databases using pg_cron.

Simplicity:   
You don't need to manually manage foreign servers or dblink connections within your cron job command. pg_cron handles the connection internally.

Security:   
pg_cron typically re-establishes a new connection for each job execution. 
You specify the username directly in schedule_in_database(), which can be more secure than hardcoding dblink connection strings everywhere.

Performance:   
While pg_cron still makes a new connection, it's optimized for this use case and avoids the overhead of FDW table scanning or potentially inefficient dblink query parsing.

**Alternatives if pg_cron.schedule_in_database() is Not Available**  

If your pg_cron version is older than 1.4 or you have a very specific scenario that isn't covered by schedule_in_database(), you could consider these options:

##### Alternative 1:  dblink (More likely for ad-hoc SQL/procedures)
   
You would create a cron.schedule() entry that uses dblink() to connect to Database B and execute the SQL or stored procedure.
 This means your pg_cron job command would look something like this:

```sql

SELECT cron.schedule(
    'my_db_b_job',
    '0 3 * * *',
    $$SELECT dblink('host=localhost user=your_user dbname=DatabaseB password=your_password',
    'CALL my_procedure_in_db_b()');$$
);


SELECT cron.schedule(
    'call_procedure',
    '0 * * * *', -- Every hour
    $$SELECT dblink_exec(
        'dbname=target_db host=localhost port=5432 user=your_user password=your_password',
        'CALL procedure_name()'
    )$$
);


SELECT cron.schedule(
    'cross_db_job',
    '0 * * * *', -- Every hour
    $$SELECT * FROM dblink(
        'dbname=target_db host=localhost port=5432 user=your_user password=your_password',
        'SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition'
    ) AS t(column1 datatype, column2 datatype)$$
);
```

Caveats:

Less intuitive for complex queries (results are returned as text or record sets).  
No direct table integration (cannot join with local tables easily).

Security Risk: Hardcoding passwords in the cron.schedule command is a major security risk. Ideally, you'd rely on .pgpass files or other secure credential management for the user pg_cron runs as.

Performance: dblink can be less performant for complex operations than postgres_fdw if you were trying to join tables between databases. However, for simply calling a stored procedure or executing a single SQL statement, it's often sufficient.

##### Alternative 2: postgres_fdw (Less direct for calling a procedure, but possible for table access)

You would need to set up postgres_fdw in Database A, creating a foreign server definition pointing to Database B (on localhost or 127.0.0.1), and user mappings.   
Then, you'd create foreign tables in Database A that represent the tables in Database B.

If you needed to run a stored procedure, you might have to create a wrapper function in Database A that calls a dblink_exec to run the procedure on the foreign server, or rethink the design if direct table access via FDW is sufficient.

Complexity: Setting up FDWs just to call a stored procedure in another database on the same instance is generally overkill compared to pg_cron.schedule_in_database() or even dblink().   
FDW shines when you need to query and join foreign tables directly from your local database.

### Conclusion
Always check if your pg_cron version supports cron.schedule_in_database(). If it does, that's the clearest and most robust solution.

If you are on an older pg_cron version that lacks schedule_in_database(),   
then dblink is the more straightforward choice for executing ad-hoc SQL or calling stored procedures in another database directly from a pg_cron job, with the important caveat of secure credential management.   
postgres_fdw is typically not the primary choice for simply executing code in another database, but rather for accessing data as if it were local.
