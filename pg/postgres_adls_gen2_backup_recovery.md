Please implement the following logic using Azure Function:

given  a Postgres table with timescaledb extension make a backup of table partition for specific date into following ADLS Gen2 folder  hierarchy: 

/pg_instance_name/schema_name/table_name/table_name.YYYY_MM_DD.csv.zip

The stored procedure you provided has **several critical issues** that will prevent it from working as intended in **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server**. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Major Issues**

#### **1. `pg_exec` Does Not Exist**
- **Problem**: The function `pg_exec` is not a built-in PostgreSQL function. It's not available in Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server.
- **Fix**: Replace `pg_exec` calls with an external process or use a different approach.

#### **2. Direct File System Access**
- **Problem**: PostgreSQL in Azure Flexible Server **cannot access the local file system** (e.g., `/tmp/`). The `COPY TO PROGRAM` and `COPY FROM PROGRAM` commands will fail.
- **Fix**: Use an external service (e.g., Azure Functions, VM) to handle file operations.

#### **3. `azcopy` Command**
- **Problem**: The `azcopy` command is not available within PostgreSQL. Even if it were, PostgreSQL cannot execute shell commands directly.
- **Fix**: Use an external process to handle the upload to ADLS Gen2.

#### **4. `drop_chunks` Function**
- **Problem**: The `drop_chunks` function is specific to TimescaleDB and requires the correct parameters. Your usage is incorrect.
- **Fix**: Use the correct TimescaleDB function syntax:
  ```sql
  CALL drop_chunks(interval => '30 days', hypertable => format('%I.%I', p_schema_name, p_table_name));
  ```

---

### **Revised Approach**
Since you cannot execute shell commands or access the file system directly from PostgreSQL in Azure Flexible Server, you need to **break this process into separate steps** using an external service (e.g., Azure Functions, VM, or Azure Data Factory).

---

### **Revised Stored Procedure**
Here's a revised version of your stored procedure that focuses only on the database operations. The file operations and ADLS uploads must be handled externally.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE backup_and_drop_old_chunk(
    p_schema_name TEXT,
    p_table_name TEXT,
    p_backup_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE - 30,
    p_reinsert BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    v_chunk_name TEXT;
    v_success BOOLEAN := FALSE;
BEGIN
    -- Find the chunk for the target date
    SELECT chunk_schema || '.' || chunk_name INTO v_chunk_name
    FROM timescaledb_information.chunks
    WHERE hypertable_schema = p_schema_name
      AND hypertable_name = p_table_name
      AND range_start <= p_backup_date
      AND range_end > p_backup_date;

    IF v_chunk_name IS NULL THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'No chunk found for date %', p_backup_date;
        RETURN;
    END IF;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Found chunk % for backup', v_chunk_name;

    -- Step 1: Export chunk data to a temporary table for external processing
    EXECUTE format('
        CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_chunk_backup AS
        SELECT * FROM %I', v_chunk_name);

    v_success := TRUE;

    -- Step 2: Drop the chunk if backup was successful
    IF v_success THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Dropping chunk %', v_chunk_name;
        PERFORM drop_chunks(
            interval => (p_backup_date - (SELECT min(range_start) FROM timescaledb_information.chunks
                                           WHERE hypertable_schema = p_schema_name AND hypertable_name = p_table_name)),
            hypertable => format('%I.%I', p_schema_name, p_table_name),
            older_than => p_backup_date
        );
    END IF;

    -- Step 3: Optionally, re-insert data from the temporary table
    IF v_success AND p_reinsert THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Re-inserting data from temporary backup';
        EXECUTE format('
            INSERT INTO %I
            SELECT * FROM temp_chunk_backup', v_chunk_name);
    END IF;

    -- Clean up
    EXECUTE 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_chunk_backup';
END;
$$;
```

### **External Process for File Handling and ADLS Upload**
You need an external process to handle the file export and upload to ADLS Gen2. Here's an example using a Python script with Azure Functions:

```python
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd
from azure.storage.filedatalake import DataLakeServiceClient
import gzip
import os

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    try:
        # Connect to PostgreSQL
        conn = psycopg2.connect(
            dbname="your_db",
            user="your_user",
            password="your_password",
            host="your_postgres_server.postgres.database.azure.com"
        )
        cur = conn.cursor()

        # Fetch data from the temporary table
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM temp_chunk_backup")
        rows = cur.fetchall()
        columns = [desc[0] for desc in cur.description]
        df = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=columns)

        # Write to a compressed CSV file
        file_name = f"chunk_backup_{pd.Timestamp.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}.csv.gz"
        local_temp_file = f"/tmp/{file_name}"
        df.to_csv(local_temp_file.replace('.gz', ''), index=False)
        with open(local_temp_file.replace('.gz', ''), 'rb') as f_in:
            with gzip.open(local_temp_file, 'wb') as f_out:
                f_out.writelines(f_in)

        # Upload to ADLS Gen2
        service_client = DataLakeServiceClient.from_connection_string("your_adls_connection_string")
        file_system_client = service_client.get_file_system_client(file_system="your_container")
        with open(local_temp_file, "rb") as data:
            file_client = file_system_client.get_file_client(file_name)
            file_client.upload_data(data, overwrite=True)

        # Clean up
        os.remove(local_temp_file)
        os.remove(local_temp_file.replace('.gz', ''))

        cur.close()
        conn.close()

        return func.HttpResponse(f"Backup uploaded to ADLS Gen2 successfully as {file_name}", status_code=200)
    except Exception as e:
        return func.HttpResponse(f"An error occurred: {e}", status_code=500)
```

---

### **Workflow**
1. **Call the Stored Procedure**: This will create a temporary table with the chunk data and drop the chunk.
   ```sql
   CALL backup_and_drop_old_chunk('your_schema', 'your_table');
   ```

2. **Run the External Process**: This will export the data from the temporary table, compress it, and upload it to ADLS Gen2.

---

### **Summary of Changes**
- Removed direct file system access and shell commands.
- Used a temporary table to hold the chunk data for external processing.
- Corrected the `drop_chunks` function call.
- Added an external process to handle file operations and ADLS uploads.

Choosing between **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** and **Azure Functions** for daily operations depends on your specific requirements. Here's a detailed comparison to help you decide:

---

### **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**
#### **Pros:**
1. **No-Code/Low-Code**: ADF provides a visual interface for designing pipelines, making it easier to set up and manage without extensive coding.
2. **Managed Service**: Azure handles the infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance.
3. **Built-in Connectors**: ADF has built-in connectors for PostgreSQL and ADLS Gen2, simplifying the integration.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: ADF provides comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting capabilities.
5. **Data Transformation**: ADF supports data transformation activities within the pipeline.
6. **Performance**: Optimized for large data transfers and transformations.

#### **Cons:**
1. **Cost**: ADF can be more expensive for high-frequency or large data volume operations.
2. **Complexity**: While it's low-code, setting up complex workflows can still be challenging.
3. **Flexibility**: Less flexible for custom logic compared to writing code in Azure Functions.

#### **Best For:**
- **ETL/ELT workflows**: When you need to extract, transform, and load data.
- **Large datasets**: When dealing with large volumes of data.
- **Teams with less coding expertise**: When you prefer a visual interface over writing code.

---

### **Azure Functions**
#### **Pros:**
1. **Serverless**: Automatically scales and you only pay for the time your function runs.
2. **Flexibility**: Full control over the code, allowing for complex logic and custom operations.
3. **Cost-Effective**: Generally cheaper for low to moderate workloads.
4. **Integration**: Easily integrates with other Azure services and can be triggered by various events.
5. **Development Speed**: Quick to develop and deploy for developers familiar with coding.

#### **Cons:**
1. **Cold Starts**: Functions may experience latency on cold starts.
2. **Complexity**: Requires coding knowledge to set up and maintain.
3. **Monitoring**: While possible, monitoring and logging are not as comprehensive as ADF out-of-the-box.
4. **Timeouts**: Functions have a maximum execution time (10 minutes for the Consumption plan).

#### **Best For:**
- **Custom logic**: When you need to implement specific business logic or transformations.
- **Event-driven workflows**: When operations are triggered by specific events.
- **Smaller datasets**: When dealing with smaller data volumes or more frequent, smaller operations.
- **Teams with coding expertise**: When you have developers who can write and maintain the code.

### **Recommendation**
#### **Use Azure Data Factory if:**
- You are dealing with **large datasets** and need a robust ETL solution.
- Your team prefers a **visual interface** and has less coding expertise.
- You need **comprehensive monitoring and logging** out-of-the-box.
- You want a **managed service** that handles scaling and maintenance.

#### **Use Azure Functions if:**
- You need **custom logic** that is not easily achievable with ADF's built-in activities.
- You are dealing with **smaller datasets** or more frequent, smaller operations.
- Your team has **coding expertise** and prefers flexibility.
- You want a **cost-effective** solution for low to moderate workloads.
- Your workflow is **event-driven**.

---

### **Hybrid Approach**
You can also use a combination of both:
- Use **Azure Data Factory** for the heavy lifting of data transfer and transformation.
- Use **Azure Functions** for custom logic or event-driven tasks that are not easily handled by ADF.

---

### **Example Workflow**
#### **Using Azure Data Factory:**
1. Create a pipeline with a **Copy Data** activity.
2. Configure the source as your PostgreSQL Flexible Server.
3. Configure the sink as your ADLS Gen2.
4. Schedule the pipeline to run daily.

#### **Using Azure Functions:**
1. Create an Azure Function with a **Timer Trigger** set to run daily.
2. Write code to connect to PostgreSQL, fetch data, and upload it to ADLS Gen2.
3. Deploy the function.
