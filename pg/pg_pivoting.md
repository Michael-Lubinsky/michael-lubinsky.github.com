### Pivoting in Postgres

There is Postgres table with columns: metric, dimension, val 
the dimension column can have values A, B and C.
Write query which returns the dimensions A, B and C as columns 
 
You can pivot the dimension values (A, B, C) into columns using FILTER with SUM() or CASE WHEN.

‚úÖ Option 1: Using FILTER (PostgreSQL-specific, cleaner)
```sql
SELECT
  metric,
  SUM(val) FILTER (WHERE dimension = 'A') AS A,
  SUM(val) FILTER (WHERE dimension = 'B') AS B,
  SUM(val) FILTER (WHERE dimension = 'C') AS C
FROM your_table
GROUP BY metric
ORDER BY metric;
```
‚úÖ Option 2: Using CASE WHEN (portable)
```sql
SELECT
  metric,
  SUM(CASE WHEN dimension = 'A' THEN val ELSE 0 END) AS A,
  SUM(CASE WHEN dimension = 'B' THEN val ELSE 0 END) AS B,
  SUM(CASE WHEN dimension = 'C' THEN val ELSE 0 END) AS C
FROM your_table
GROUP BY metric
ORDER BY metric;
```

To include unknown or dynamic dimension values as columns, you need to dynamically pivot the data.   
PostgreSQL provides two common methods for this:

‚úÖ Option 1: crosstab() (from tablefunc extension)

This is the most efficient way to pivot dynamically known values.

1. Enable the extension (once per database):
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

3. Use crosstab():
SELECT * FROM crosstab(
  $$SELECT metric, dimension, val FROM your_table ORDER BY metric, dimension$$
) AS ct(metric TEXT, A INT, B INT, C INT);
Replace A INT, B INT, C INT with the list of expected dimensions.

This still requires you to know the dimensions in advance, so it‚Äôs semi-dynamic.

If you want fully dynamic column names, you must use dynamic SQL.

‚úÖ Option 2: Fully Dynamic Pivot Using PL/pgSQL
If you don‚Äôt know the dimensions in advance, you need to:

Query all unique dimensions.

Build a pivot SQL dynamically.

Execute it.

Example: dynamic SQL in psql or PL/pgSQL
```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    col_list TEXT;
    sql TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Step 1: Build dynamic column list like: 
    -- "MAX(CASE WHEN dimension = 'A' THEN val END) AS A, ..."
    SELECT string_agg(
        format('MAX(CASE WHEN dimension = %L THEN val END) AS %I', dimension, dimension),
        ', '
    )
    INTO col_list
    FROM (SELECT DISTINCT dimension FROM your_table) sub;

    -- Step 2: Build and execute dynamic SQL
    sql := format('SELECT metric, %s FROM your_table GROUP BY metric ORDER BY metric;', col_list);

    RAISE NOTICE 'Query: %', sql; -- for debugging
    EXECUTE sql;
END $$;
```
This prints the result to the console but to return results to a client, you'd need to wrap it in a function that returns TABLE(...).

üü° Note:
If you need to consume the dynamic result in Python, pandas, etc., then running the dynamic SQL and reading the result as a DataFrame is usually more practical.



When using dynamic SQL inside a DO $$ ... $$; block or a PL/pgSQL function, you can't directly return query results to the client unless you define a function that returns a TABLE (or SETOF RECORD).

Here‚Äôs how to do it properly:

‚úÖ 1. Create a function that returns TABLE(...)
If you want to return the result of a dynamic pivot query as a regular result set, you can use RETURN QUERY EXECUTE ... inside a RETURNS TABLE(...) function.

üß© Example: Pivot dimension values into columns dynamically
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_pivoted_metrics()
RETURNS TABLE(metric TEXT, A INT, B INT, C INT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql AS
$$
DECLARE
    sql TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Build dynamic SQL using known or discovered dimensions
    sql := $sql$
        SELECT
            metric,
            MAX(CASE WHEN dimension = 'A' THEN val END) AS A,
            MAX(CASE WHEN dimension = 'B' THEN val END) AS B,
            MAX(CASE WHEN dimension = 'C' THEN val END) AS C
        FROM your_table
        GROUP BY metric
        ORDER BY metric;
    $sql$;

    -- Return the result of dynamic SQL
    RETURN QUERY EXECUTE sql;
END
$$;
Now you can query it like this:

SELECT * FROM get_pivoted_metrics();
‚úÖ To make it truly dynamic (dimensions unknown at design time):
You'd need to:

Discover dimension values with SELECT DISTINCT dimension.

Dynamically construct the column list and return type.

Use RETURNS SETOF RECORD and cast it when calling.

That looks like:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_dynamic_pivot()
RETURNS SETOF RECORD
LANGUAGE plpgsql AS
$$
DECLARE
    col_list TEXT;
    sql TEXT;
BEGIN
    SELECT string_agg(
        format('MAX(CASE WHEN dimension = %L THEN val END) AS %I', dimension, dimension),
        ', '
    )
    INTO col_list
    FROM (SELECT DISTINCT dimension FROM your_table) sub;

    sql := format('SELECT metric, %s FROM your_table GROUP BY metric', col_list);

    RETURN QUERY EXECUTE sql;
END
$$;
But now you must explicitly specify the expected columns and types when calling it:

SELECT * FROM get_dynamic_pivot()
AS t(metric TEXT, A INT, B INT, C INT, D INT);  -- You must provide a type signature
üîÑ Summary
Approach	Returns result to client	Columns known at compile time?	Can be called like regular table?
RETURNS TABLE(...)	‚úÖ	‚úÖ	‚úÖ
RETURNS SETOF RECORD	‚úÖ (with AS t(...))	‚ùå	‚ùå (manual type declaration needed)
DO $$ BEGIN ... END $$	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚ùå
Let me know if you want a version that automatically infers column names and types without needing to specify them manually at query time ‚Äî it requires procedural workaround or client-side postprocessing.
