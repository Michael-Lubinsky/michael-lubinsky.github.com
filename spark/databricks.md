4 Certifications Completed on My Data Journey ✨
▸ Databricks Data Engineer Professional
▸ Microsoft DP-700: Data Analyst Associate
▸ Microsoft DP-600: Fabric Analytics Solution Expert
▸ Databricks Data Engineer Associate

Over the past few months, I set a clear goal to deepen my skills across Databricks, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Fabric —with a core focus on data engineering: building scalable pipelines, lakehouse architecture, and robust data solutions.
To complement this, I pursued DP-600 to enhance my understanding of analytics, reporting, and data modeling — bridging engineering with business insights across the full data lifecycle.

This journey taught me that success is not just about certifications — it’s about learning with purpose, staying consistent, and having the right guidance along the way.

🔴 A special thank you to Ansh Lamba — your well-structured videos, from beginner to advanced, made every concept crystal clear. Your content has been my go-to resource throughout this journey.  
🔴 Grateful to Siddhesh Hindalekar — your timely guidance, encouragement, and support kept me on track and made this achievement possible.  
🔴 Appreciation to the Microsoft Fabric team — the hands-on learning paths and training resources truly made a difference.  
🔴  Thanks to the Databricks team for the robust documentation and learning support that simplified even the most complex topics.
