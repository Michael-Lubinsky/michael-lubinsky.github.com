I passed the Databricks 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻!

Honestly, this was one of the most brain-cracking certifications I've taken — it covers a wider range of concepts like Delta Live Tables (DLT), Unity Catalog, Apache Spark, Delta Lake, MLflow, Databricks CLI, and a lot more. It took me around 4 weeks to prepare.

As per the official Databricks guide, the exam consists of 60 questions, but lucky me — I got 65 questions! 😂 You get 2 hours to complete it. Need to manage time, as the questions are too lengthy. The questions are seriously designed to make you doubt yourself at every step. 😅 

Here’s how the topics are distributed:
```
• Data Processing (30%)
• Databricks Tooling (20%)
• Data Modeling (20%)
• Security & Governance (10%)
• Monitoring & Logging (10%)
• Testing & Deployment (10%)
```
I highly recommend going thoroughly through all the official documentation provided by Databricks (I stuck to their course material and notebooks).

Since there’s no official practice test from Databricks, it was a bit difficult to test knowledge — but there are a few good ones available on Udemy if you want extra practice.

4 Certifications Completed on My Data Journey ✨
▸ Databricks Data Engineer Professional
▸ Microsoft DP-700: Data Analyst Associate
▸ Microsoft DP-600: Fabric Analytics Solution Expert
▸ Databricks Data Engineer Associate

Over the past few months, I set a clear goal to deepen my skills across Databricks, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Fabric —with a core focus on data engineering: building scalable pipelines, lakehouse architecture, and robust data solutions.
To complement this, I pursued DP-600 to enhance my understanding of analytics, reporting, and data modeling — bridging engineering with business insights across the full data lifecycle.

This journey taught me that success is not just about certifications — it’s about learning with purpose, staying consistent, and having the right guidance along the way.

🔴 A special thank you to Ansh Lamba — your well-structured videos, from beginner to advanced, made every concept crystal clear. Your content has been my go-to resource throughout this journey.  
🔴 Grateful to Siddhesh Hindalekar — your timely guidance, encouragement, and support kept me on track and made this achievement possible.  
🔴 Appreciation to the Microsoft Fabric team — the hands-on learning paths and training resources truly made a difference.  
🔴  Thanks to the Databricks team for the robust documentation and learning support that simplified even the most complex topics.
