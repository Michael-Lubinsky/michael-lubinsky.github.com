## Apache Hudi (Hadoop Upserts Deletes and Incrementals) 
```
Hidi is an open-source data lake platform that helps you efficiently manage large-scale data
 on cloud storage like Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or HDFS.
 It's designed for streaming and batch data processing, and it brings database-like capabilities to data lakes.

Hudi lets you insert, update, and delete records on a data lake —
something traditional data lakes aren't great at.
It supports near real-time ingestion and incremental queries,
making it ideal for modern data engineering and analytics.

```

### 🧠 Key Features:
Upserts & Deletes: Unlike standard Parquet or ORC files, Hudi allows record-level updates and deletes.

Incremental Processing: Query only what's changed (like CDC—Change Data Capture).

ACID Transactions: Ensures consistent and atomic data writes.

Built-in Indexing: Speeds up lookups during updates.

Snapshot & Read-Optimized Queries:

Snapshot: See the latest version of records.

Read-Optimized: Faster, columnar reads for analytics (e.g., Apache Hive or Presto).

Compaction & Cleaning: Background processes to optimize storage and performance.

Metadata Table: Improves query performance by avoiding directory listings.

### 🛠️ Works well with:
- Apache Spark (primary engine for writes)
- Presto / Trino / Hive (for querying)
- Databricks
- AWS EMR / GCP / Azure

📦 Use Cases:
1. Real-time data ingestion (e.g., from Kafka)
2. Change Data Capture (CDC)
3. GDPR/CCPA compliance (deleting or updating records)
4. Streaming ETL pipelines
5. Large-scale data lake management
