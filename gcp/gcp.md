### GCP

### Dataflow** and **Dataproc

**Dataflow** and **Dataproc** are two different Google Cloud services for processing large-scale data ‚Äî 
but they serve different use cases and are built on different paradigms:

* * *

## üß† **High-Level Summary**

| Feature | **Cloud Dataflow** | **Cloud Dataproc**
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Type** | Serverless stream & batch data processing | Managed Apache Hadoop/Spark/Presto clusters

The **closest equivalent to Apache Airflow** in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** is:

> ‚úÖ **Cloud Composer**

* * *

## üß† What is Cloud Composer?

**Cloud Composer** is GCP‚Äôs **managed Apache Airflow service**.  
It provides **workflow orchestration** for your data pipelines ‚Äî just like open-source Airflow ‚Äî
but without the burden of managing the underlying infrastructure.

* * *

## üîß Key Features

Feature  | Cloud Composer (GCP Managed Airflow) |
|--------|------------| 
**Orchestrator** | Apache Airflow (open source) |

**Managed by** | Google Cloud (updates, scaling, security)

**Language** | Python (Airflow DAGs)

**Integrations** | BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc, Cloud Run, GCS, Pub/Sub, etc.

**Version Control** | Supports custom Airflow versions

**UI** | Airflow Web UI via GCP Console

**Environment Isolation** | Each Composer environment runs in its own GKE cluster

**Monitoring** | Integrated with Stackdriver (Cloud Logging, Monitoring)

* * *

## üß¨ Common Use Cases

-   Run and schedule ETL jobs
    
-   Trigger Dataflow pipelines or BigQuery scripts
    
-   Manage cross-service dependencies
    
-   Send alerts on job failures
    
-   Chain Python, Bash, SQL, and REST tasks
    

* * *

## üîÅ Example DAG (Python)

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash
import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime
 with DAG('my_composer_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval='@daily')
 as dag:
       task1 = BashOperator(
            task_id='print_hello',
           bash_command='echo Hello from Composer!'
       )
```
* * *

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison: Cloud Composer vs. Apache Airflow

| Feature | Cloud Composer | Self-hosted Apache Airflow
|--------|--------|----| 
| **Hosting** | GCP-managed (runs on GKE) | User-managed |
| **Setup Time** | Minutes | Hours or more

| **Scaling** | Automatic (within limits) | Manual

|**Integration** | Deep GCP integration | Requires plugins

| **Cost** | Higher (GCP infra + Composer) | Lower infra, but labor cost

**Upgrades** | Google-managed or manual | Manual

* * *

## üíµ Pricing Notes

Cloud Composer charges based on:

-   **Environment uptime (vCPUs, memory)**
    
-   **Storage (DAGs, logs)**
    
-   **GKE cluster usage**
    

If cost is a concern, **Composer 2** is much more cost-efficient than Composer 1,
due to autoscaling and better separation of control/data planes.

* * *
