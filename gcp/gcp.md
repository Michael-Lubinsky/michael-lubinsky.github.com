### GCP


* * *

### **GCS (Google Cloud Storage)**

**Purpose:**  
Object storage for any type of data—files, images, backups, logs, etc.

**Key Features:**

-   **Scalable & Durable:** Stores massive amounts of unstructured data with high durability (11 9's).
    
-   **Buckets & Objects:** Data is stored in _buckets_ and each file is called an _object_.
    
-   **Classes:** Offers different storage classes like Standard, Nearline, Coldline, and Archive based on access frequency and cost.
    
-   **Access:** Can be accessed via REST API, SDKs, or `gsutil` CLI.
    
-   **Use Cases:** Backup, media storage, Big Data input/output, machine learning datasets, website hosting.
    

**Example Use:**  
You can store a `.csv` file in GCS and later read it from a data processing pipeline.

* * *

###   **Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe)**

**Purpose:**  
Real-time messaging service for decoupling systems that produce and consume data.

**Key Features:**

-   **Asynchronous Messaging:** Enables real-time, scalable, event-driven systems.
    
-   **Publisher-Subscriber Model:** Publishers send messages to a _topic_, and subscribers receive messages from that topic.
    
-   **Durability & Scalability:** Supports millions of messages per second.
    
-   **Push & Pull Modes:** Subscribers can either pull messages or have them pushed to a webhook.
    
-   **Use Cases:** Event ingestion pipelines, microservices communication, log aggregation, streaming analytics.
    

**Example Use:**  
A system logs user clicks, publishes each click event to a Pub/Sub topic, and a downstream analytics service consumes these events for processing.

* * *

### **How They Work Together:**

-   You can **store files in GCS**, and when a new file is uploaded, **trigger a Pub/Sub message** to notify downstream systems to process it.
    
-   Example: Uploading a JSON file to GCS triggers a Cloud Function via Pub/Sub to parse and store the data in BigQuery.




### Dataflow  and Dataproc

**Dataflow** and **Dataproc** are two different Google Cloud services for processing large-scale data — 
but they serve different use cases and are built on different paradigms:

* * *

The **closest equivalent to Apache Airflow** in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** is:

> ✅ **Cloud Composer**

* * *

## 🧠 What is Cloud Composer?

**Cloud Composer** is GCP’s **managed Apache Airflow service**.  
It provides **workflow orchestration** for your data pipelines — just like open-source Airflow —
but without the burden of managing the underlying infrastructure.

* * *

## 🔧 Key Features

Feature  | Cloud Composer (GCP Managed Airflow) |
|--------|------------| 
| **Orchestrator** | Apache Airflow (open source) |
| **Managed by** | Google Cloud (updates, scaling, security)
| **Language** | Python (Airflow DAGs)
| **Integrations** | BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc, Cloud Run, GCS, Pub/Sub, etc.
| **Version Control** | Supports custom Airflow versions
| **UI** | Airflow Web UI via GCP Console
| **Environment Isolation** | Each Composer environment runs in its own GKE cluster
| **Monitoring** | Integrated with Stackdriver (Cloud Logging, Monitoring)

* * *

## 🧬 Common Use Cases

-   Run and schedule ETL jobs
    
-   Trigger Dataflow pipelines or BigQuery scripts
    
-   Manage cross-service dependencies
    
-   Send alerts on job failures
    
-   Chain Python, Bash, SQL, and REST tasks
    

* * *

## 🔁 Example DAG (Python)

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash
import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime
 with DAG('my_composer_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval='@daily')
 as dag:
       task1 = BashOperator(
            task_id='print_hello',
           bash_command='echo Hello from Composer!'
       )
```
* * *

## ⚖️ Comparison: Cloud Composer vs. Apache Airflow

| Feature | Cloud Composer | Self-hosted Apache Airflow
|--------|--------|----| 
| **Hosting** | GCP-managed (runs on GKE) | User-managed |
| **Setup Time** | Minutes | Hours or more
| **Scaling** | Automatic (within limits) | Manual
|**Integration** | Deep GCP integration | Requires plugins
| **Cost** | Higher (GCP infra + Composer) | Lower infra, but labor cost
| **Upgrades** | Google-managed or manual | Manual

* * *

## 💵 Pricing Notes

Cloud Composer charges based on:

-   **Environment uptime (vCPUs, memory)**
    
-   **Storage (DAGs, logs)**
    
-   **GKE cluster usage**
    

If cost is a concern, **Composer 2** is much more cost-efficient than Composer 1,
due to autoscaling and better separation of control/data planes.
