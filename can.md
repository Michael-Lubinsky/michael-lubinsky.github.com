# CAN Bus

Telemetry collected from cars via CAN bus is rich and multi-layered. 

Here are the main categories of **data analysis** you can perform with it:

---

## 1. **Descriptive Analytics**

* **Sensor statistics:** Compute averages, medians, standard deviations, min/max values per sensor (e.g., RPM, temperature, speed).
* **Trip summaries:** Distance traveled, duration, fuel/energy consumption, start/end locations.
* **Event counts:** Number of braking events, gear changes, charging events (for EVs), ABS activations, etc.
* **Time-of-day / day-of-week patterns:** Morning vs evening driving behavior, weekdays vs weekends.

---

## 2. **Diagnostic Analytics**

* **Outlier detection:** Spot abnormal sensor readings (e.g., speed > 500 mph, engine temperature spikes).
* **Fault analysis:** Correlate sensor anomalies with fault codes (if available).
* **Lag/gap detection:** Find missing signals or delays between trips.
* **Root cause investigation:** Compare events leading to breakdowns, accidents, or unusual performance.

---

## 3. **Predictive Analytics**

* **Predictive maintenance:** Use vibration, temperature, or pressure trends to forecast failures (e.g., tire wear, brake pad issues).
* **Fuel/energy efficiency models:** Predict expected fuel economy or battery usage under certain conditions.
* **Driver behavior scoring:** Predict accident risks or insurance categories from aggressive driving signals.
* **Trip prediction:** Estimate trip time, route choice, or likely destination.

---

## 4. **Prescriptive Analytics**

* **Optimization recommendations:** Suggest more fuel-efficient driving patterns.
* **Maintenance scheduling:** Recommend proactive servicing when approaching predicted failure thresholds.
* **Fleet management:** Recommend vehicle rotation strategies to balance wear and tear.

---

## 5. **Advanced Analytics**

* **Sensor correlations:** Cross-sensor analysis (e.g., acceleration vs fuel consumption).
* **Clustering:** Group trips or drivers into patterns (e.g., aggressive vs conservative driving styles).
* **Anomaly detection with ML:** Use models to identify sensor streams that deviate from expected patterns.
* **Geospatial analytics:** Overlay trips on maps, analyze city vs highway patterns, charging station usage, congestion.
* **Time-series analysis:** Apply rolling windows, seasonal patterns, forecasting of sensor signals.

---

## 6. **Domain-Specific Insights**

* **For ICE (internal combustion engines):** Engine load cycles, emission estimates, cold start analysis.
* **For EVs:** Charging events, battery health, state-of-charge curves, regenerative braking contribution.
* **Safety analytics:** ABS/EBS activation, traction control usage, near-collision detection from acceleration/gyroscope sensors.

Would you like me to **draft a reference pipeline design** (like the one we did for CAN bus earlier) that goes from raw sensor ingestion → cleaning/outlier filtering → statistical summaries → predictive/ML models? That way, you’d have a blueprint of *how to implement* these analyses in Databricks/Snowflake.
