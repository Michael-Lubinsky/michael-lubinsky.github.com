## üìç Machine Learning Algorithms for GPS Data

GPS data typically includes latitude, longitude, timestamp,   
and sometimes speed, altitude, and direction. 

Here are various ML algorithms and use cases that can be applied:

---

## 1. üß≠ Trajectory Clustering
### Goal:
Group similar movement paths (e.g., common routes, behaviors)

### Algorithms:
- **DBSCAN / HDBSCAN**: Density-based spatial clustering
- **K-Means (with projection)**: If converted to Cartesian
- **Hierarchical clustering**
- **Trajectory-specific**: TRACLUS, ST-DBSCAN

---

## 2. üó∫Ô∏è Map Matching
### Goal:
Snap raw GPS points to road network

### Algorithms:
- **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**: Most common for map matching
- **Viterbi algorithm**: To find the most probable path

---

## 3. üïµÔ∏è Anomaly Detection
### Goal:
Detect abnormal routes, erratic driving, or spoofed data

### Algorithms:
- **Isolation Forest**
- **Autoencoders**
- **One-Class SVM**
- **LSTM reconstruction error** (for sequences)

---

## 4. üöó Movement Pattern Prediction
### Goal:
Predict next location, route, or user behavior

### Algorithms:
- **RNN / LSTM / GRU**: Sequence modeling
- **Transformer models**
- **Markov Chains**

---

## 5. üß† Classification Tasks
### Goal:
Label type of activity or transport mode (walking, driving, biking)

### Algorithms:
- **Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM**
- **CNN (with time-series features or heatmaps)**
- **LSTM + dense layers**

---

## 6. ‚è±Ô∏è Time Series Forecasting
### Goal:
Predict arrival time (ETA), congestion, or traffic volume

### Algorithms:
- **ARIMA, Prophet**
- **LSTM**
- **Temporal Convolutional Networks**

---

## 7. üß≠ Route Optimization / Path Planning
### Goal:
Suggest optimal routes or travel schedules

### Algorithms:
- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **A* / Dijkstra** (classical but useful)
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for road graphs

---

## 8. üîç Geofencing & Region Detection
### Goal:
Detect entry/exit from defined areas (e.g., warehouses, danger zones)

### Algorithms:
- **Point-in-polygon** algorithms (geospatial)
- **Binary classification models** with zone features

---

## Libraries and Tools:
- **scikit-learn, XGBoost** for classical ML
- **PyTorch, TensorFlow** for deep learning
- **geopandas, shapely, folium** for spatial processing
- **Kepler.gl, Leaflet, Mapbox** for visualization
