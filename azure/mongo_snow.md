# Data Transfer From MongoDB to Snowflake
Weavix MongoDB collections can be updated
New Weavix MongoDB can be created any time

In this case we need to implement Change Data Capture (CDC) Pipeline

## Azure Data Factory Pipeline 

Why Use Azure Data Factory (ADF) for MongoDB → Snowflake?
Azure Data Factory (ADF) is absolutely a strong candidate for this use case. 
It was omitted in the first pipeline because:

You asked for efficiency, and

ADF can sometimes feel heavy or costly for simple or highly dynamic Mongo collections 
(e.g., auto-discovering new collections and schemas)

But for managed orchestration and low-code pipelines, ADF does make sense, especially if:

### When ADF is a Good Fit

| Scenario                                 | ADF Strength            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Scheduled, automated data movement       | ✅ Native                |
| Azure-native data orchestration          | ✅ Excellent integration |
| Transformations with minimal code        | ✅ Built-in Data Flows   |
| Monitoring and retry logic               | ✅ Built-in              |
| Team prefers low-code / visual pipelines | ✅ Ideal                 |


### Where ADF Has Limitations

| Scenario                                  | Reason                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MongoDB with many dynamic collections** | ADF is not dynamic — you must **manually define** each collection-to-sink mapping or generate it programmatically |
| **Need to flatten deeply nested JSON**    | ADF has limited ability to handle complex nested data without external transformation (i.e., Python or Spark)     |
| **Need full schema control / versioning** | Easier in code-based ETL than ADF UI                                                                              |
| **Frequent schema drift**                 | Harder to manage in ADF UI                                                                                        |



Azure Data Factory Pipeline

- Triggers the pipeline on a schedule (every N minutes/hours)
- Lists all collections in MongoDB
- Submits each collection for processing via event or job queue (e.g., Azure Queue)


### Are you recommending Azure Function or Azure data factory fir thi pipeline?


Great question! Let me clarify the optimal approach.  
I recommend Azure Data Factory as the primary orchestrator with minimal Azure Functions only where absolutely necessary.

Recommended Approach: ADF-Centric Pipeline
Azure Data Factory Should Handle:
1 Collection Discovery - Using native MongoDB connector
2 Data Movement - MongoDB to ADLS Gen2 to Snowflake
3 Orchestration - Scheduling, error handling, monitoring
4 Change Data Capture - Through scheduled incremental loads

Azure Functions Only For:
1 MongoDB Change Streams (if real-time CDC is critical)
2 Complex custom logic that ADF can't handle natively

#### Why ADF-Centric is Better:

Enhanced MongoDB to Snowflake Pipeline for Dynamic Collections

My Recommendation: Azure Data Factory Primary

ADF Advantages:
- Native MongoDB Connector - No custom code needed
- Built-in Error Handling - Automatic retries, dead letter queues
- Visual Pipeline Designer - Easy to maintain and debug
- Enterprise Features - Monitoring, alerting, SLA management
- Cost Predictable - Fixed monthly cost (~$50-100)
- Scaling - Automatic with Data Integration Units

Functions Disadvantages for ETL:

- Timeout Limits - 10 minutes max execution time
- State Management - Complex for long-running processes
- Error Recovery - Manual implementation needed
- Monitoring Complexity - Multiple functions to track
- Cold Start Delays - Inconsistent performance
- 
When to Use Each:

Use ADF For:
✅ Collection Discovery - List collections, get stats
✅ Bulk Data Movement - MongoDB → ADLS → Snowflake
✅ Scheduled Processing - Hourly/daily batch loads
✅ Pipeline Orchestration - Complex workflows
✅ Error Handling - Built-in retry and monitoring

Use Functions Only For:
⚠️ Real-time Change Streams - If sub-hour latency is critical
⚠️ Custom Business Logic - Complex transformations ADF can't handle
⚠️ Event-driven Triggers - Immediate response to specific events

Recommended Hybrid Approach:
90% ADF + 10% Functions

1 Primary Pipeline: ADF handles all collection discovery and bulk data movement
2 Optional Functions: Only for critical collections requiring real-time CDC
3 Event Hub: Bridge between Functions and ADF for real-time triggers


Cost Comparison:
- ADF-Only: $50-100/month + compute costs
- Functions-Heavy: $20-200/month + unpredictable scaling costs
- Hybrid: $70-120/month (predictable)
Bottom Line: Start with ADF-only. Add Functions later only if you need sub-hour latency for specific collections.




**No, you don't need Azure Blob Storage or Azure Container Instances for this pipeline.**

Let me explain why and what you actually need:

## **Azure Blob Storage - NOT Needed**

### Why NOT:
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) replaces it** - ADLS Gen2 is built on Blob Storage but optimized for analytics
- **ADLS Gen2 has hierarchical namespace** - Better for organizing data by database/collection/date
- **Native Snowflake integration** - Snowflake works better with ADLS Gen2
- **Better performance** - Optimized for large file operations

### **Use ADLS Gen2 Instead:**
```
Container: datalake
├── raw/mongodb/
│   ├── database1/collection1/year=2024/month=01/day=15/
│   └── database2/collection2/year=2024/month=01/day=15/
├── staging/snowflake/
└── processed/
```

## **Azure Container Instances - NOT Needed**

### Why NOT:
- **Azure Data Factory handles orchestration** - No need for custom containers
- **Serverless approach is better** - Functions scale automatically
- **Additional complexity** - Container management overhead
- **Higher costs** - Always-on containers vs pay-per-execution

### **What Handles Container-like Tasks:**
- **Azure Data Factory** - Pipeline orchestration
- **Azure Functions** - Serverless compute (if needed)
- **Snowflake** - Data processing and transformation

## **What You Actually Need:**## **Storage Architecture:**

### **ADLS Gen2 Structure:**
```
Storage Account: yourdatalake
├── Container: raw
│   └── mongodb/
│       ├── database1/
│       │   ├── collection1/year=2024/month=01/day=15/hour=10/
│       │   └── collection2/year=2024/month=01/day=15/hour=10/
│       └── database2/
│           └── collection3/year=2024/month=01/day=15/hour=10/
├── Container: staging
│   └── snowflake/
└── Container: processed
    └── analytics/
```

## **Why This Architecture Works:**

### **ADLS Gen2 Benefits:**
- **Hierarchical Namespace** - Organize by database/collection/date
- **Snowflake Native Integration** - Direct `COPY INTO` commands
- **Cost Effective** - Pay only for storage used
- **Performance** - Optimized for large analytics workloads
- **Security** - Role-based access control

### **ADF Benefits:**
- **Managed Service** - No infrastructure to maintain
- **Native Connectors** - MongoDB and Snowflake built-in
- **Visual Designer** - Easy pipeline creation and maintenance
- **Enterprise Features** - Monitoring, alerting, retry logic
- **Auto-scaling** - Scales with workload automatically

## **Total Service Requirements:**

### **Minimal Setup (Recommended):**
```
1. Azure Data Factory          ($50-100/month)
2. ADLS Gen2                   ($20-50/month)
3. Azure Key Vault             ($5/month)
4. Snowflake (External)        ($200+/month)
───────────────────────────────────────────
Total Azure Cost: $75-155/month
```

### **With Real-time CDC (If Needed):**
```
1. Azure Data Factory          ($50-100/month)
2. ADLS Gen2                   ($20-50/month)
3. Azure Key Vault             ($5/month)
4. Azure Functions             ($10-30/month)
5. Azure Event Hub             ($10-20/month)
───────────────────────────────────────────
Total Azure Cost: $95-205/month
```

## **Container Alternative (NOT Recommended):**

If you insisted on using containers, you'd need:
- **Azure Container Instances**: $30-100/month (always running)
- **Azure Container Registry**: $5/month
- **Custom code maintenance**: Developer time
- **Orchestration complexity**: Additional logic needed

**This would cost MORE and provide LESS functionality than the ADF approach.**

## **Final Recommendation:**

**Start with just these 3 services:**
1. **Azure Data Factory** - Pipeline orchestration
2. **ADLS Gen2** - Data staging
3. **Azure Key Vault** - Credential management

This gives you a complete, enterprise-grade ETL pipeline for ~$75-155/month in Azure costs (plus Snowflake costs).

Would you like me to show you the specific ADLS Gen2 configuration and how it integrates with ADF and Snowflake?


# Streamlined MongoDB to Snowflake Pipeline (No Spark)

## Recommended Architecture: ADF-Centric

```
MongoDB Collections → Azure Data Factory → ADLS Gen2 → Snowflake → Analytics Tables
        ↓                      ↓             ↓          ↓
   Native Connector      Orchestration    Staging    Native Loading
```

**Optional for Real-time CDC:**
```
MongoDB Change Streams → Azure Functions → Event Hub → ADF Trigger
```

## Required Azure Services

### **Core Services (Required):**

1. **Azure Data Factory** 
   - Pipeline orchestration
   - MongoDB native connector
   - Snowflake native connector
   - Cost: ~$50-100/month

2. **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)**
   - Staging area for data files
   - Hierarchical namespace for organization
   - Native integration with Snowflake
   - Cost: ~$20-50/month (depending on volume)

3. **Azure Key Vault**
   - Store connection strings securely
   - MongoDB credentials
   - Snowflake credentials
   - Cost: ~$5/month

### **Optional Services:**

4. **Azure Functions** (Only if real-time CDC needed)
   - MongoDB Change Streams processing
   - Event-driven triggers
   - Cost: ~$10-30/month

5. **Azure Event Hub** (Only with Functions)
   - Bridge between Functions and ADF
   - Real-time event streaming
   - Cost: ~$10-20/month

### **NOT Needed:**
❌ **Azure Blob Storage** - Replaced by ADLS Gen2  
❌ **Azure Container Instances** - Replaced by ADF + Functions  
❌ **Azure Kubernetes Service** - Overkill for this use case  
❌ **Azure Service Bus** - Event Hub sufficient if needed  
❌ **Azure Logic Apps** - ADF handles orchestration better


### The data flow is: MongoDB → ADLS Gen2 → Snowflake**

### **Step 1: MongoDB → ADLS Gen2**

**HOW**: Azure Data Factory Copy Activity with MongoDB connector

**WHAT HAPPENS:**
1. ADF connects to MongoDB using native connector
2. Extracts documents in batches (10,000 docs per batch)
3. Converts to Parquet format (compressed, columnar)
4. Writes to ADLS Gen2 in organized folder structure

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**
```
Your MongoDB collection with 1 million documents becomes:
├── part-00000.parquet (333k documents, 150MB)
├── part-00001.parquet (333k documents, 150MB) 
└── part-00002.parquet (334k documents, 150MB)

Total: 450MB (vs 2GB+ if kept as JSON)
```

### **Step 2: ADLS Gen2 → Snowflake**

**HOW**: Snowflake's `COPY INTO` command or ADF Copy Activity

**WHAT HAPPENS:**
1. Snowflake creates external stage pointing to ADLS Gen2
2. `COPY INTO` command reads Parquet files directly
3. Transforms JSON documents into structured columns
4. Loads into target Snowflake table

**EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION:**
```sql
-- MongoDB Document:
{"_id": "123", "name": "John", "address": {"city": "Seattle"}}

-- Becomes Snowflake Row:
_id: "123"
document_data: {"_id": "123", "name": "John", "address": {"city": "Seattle"}}
name: "John"
address_city: "Seattle"
etl_timestamp: 2024-01-15 10:30:00
```

## **Why Staging is Essential:**

### **1. Performance Benefits:**
- **3-5x faster loading** (Parquet vs JSON)
- **70% smaller files** (compression)
- **Parallel processing** of multiple files

### **2. Reliability Benefits:**
- **Resume failed loads** without re-extracting from MongoDB
- **Data backup** in case of Snowflake issues
- **Audit trail** of what was processed when

### **3. Cost Benefits:**
- **Cheaper storage** in ADLS Gen2 vs Snowflake
- **Shorter Snowflake warehouse runtime** (faster loads)
- **Batch processing** reduces network costs

The staging approach is industry standard for data warehouses - it provides better performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness than direct MongoDB→Snowflake transfers.

What About this pipeline:
1. Azure Data Factory with MongoDB connection
2. *Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)
3. 1. Snowflake creates external stage pointing to ADLS Gen2
4. COPY INTO command reads Parquet files directly
5 Transforms JSON documents into structured columns
6. Loads into target Snowflake table


ChatGPT said:
You're on the right track — that pipeline is well-architected, scalable, and avoids overengineering. Let's break it down and assess how it works, what's good, and what needs consideration:

✅ Your Proposed Pipeline (Refined)
1. Azure Data Factory connects to MongoDB
ADF uses a Self-hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) to access MongoDB.

Collections are copied as-is (BSON → JSON) or transformed to Parquet via Mapping Data Flows (if needed).

Each collection can be loaded individually on a schedule.

2. Writes to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
Destination for raw or semi-processed collection dumps (e.g., Parquet files).

Optionally partitioned by date/collection for efficient access.

Example: adls://your-container/mongo_exports/collection_name/date=2025-08-04/*.parquet

3. Snowflake creates External Stage
```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE adls_stage
URL='azure://<account>.dfs.core.windows.net/<container>/mongo_exports'
STORAGE_INTEGRATION = your_azure_integration;
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'PARQUET');
```
4. COPY INTO reads from Parquet files
No need to move data between ADLS and Snowflake — it's direct.

```sql

COPY INTO target_table
FROM @adls_stage/collection_name/date=2025-08-04/
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'PARQUET');
```
5. Transforms JSON into structured columns
You define a target schema (with flattening done via ADF Mapping Data Flows or earlier).

Nested arrays or maps should be flattened before writing to ADLS.

6. Loads into optimized Snowflake tables
Final tables can be:

Clustered (for fast filters on user_id, timestamp, etc.)

Normalized into multiple tables if needed

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **ADF with MongoDB**         | Fully managed, no code for orchestration                |
| ✅ **ADLS Gen2**                | Cheap, scalable storage, integrates well with Snowflake |
| ✅ **Parquet format**           | Columnar, compact, schema-friendly                      |
| ✅ **Snowflake External Stage** | Efficient direct access without staging in Snowflake    |
| ✅ **COPY INTO**                | Easy to automate and control data load                  |
| ✅ **Structured tables**        | Optimized for JOINs, filters, aggregates                |

| Challenge                                                                      | Mitigation                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ADF Mapping Data Flows may struggle with deeply nested or inconsistent schemas | Flatten JSON with Python prior to loading to ADLS, or use schema drift features carefully |
| Frequent new Mongo collections require updating ADF pipeline manually          | Automate ADF pipeline using parameterized pipeline + Lookup activity + ForEach            |
| Schema evolution (MongoDB fields change over time)                             | Use Snowflake `VARIANT` types or load into staging table first and normalize later        |
| Performance tuning in Snowflake                                                | Use `CLUSTER BY`, `MERGE INTO`, and avoid wide `VARIANT` loads unless needed              |


Example Target Table in Snowflake (after flattening)
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE users_flat (
    _id STRING,
    name STRING,
    email STRING,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    last_login TIMESTAMP
)
CLUSTER BY (_id);
```
