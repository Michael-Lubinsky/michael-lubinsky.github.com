### **Overview of Pipelines**
1. **Pipeline #1**: MQTT Broker -> Azure Event Hub -> Mongo -> Postgres (Current)
2. **Pipeline #2**: MQTT Broker -> Azure Event Hub -> (Mongo and Azure Blob Storage) -> Snowflake
3. **Pipeline #3**: MQTT Broker -> Azure Event Hub -> (Mongo and Snowflake)
4. **Pipeline #4**: MQTT Broker -> Azure Event Hub -> Mongo -> Snowflake (New)

---

### **Pipeline #4: MQTT Broker -> Azure Event Hub -> Mongo -> Snowflake**
In this pipeline, data flows from the MQTT Broker to Azure Event Hub, then to MongoDB for operational storage, and subsequently to Snowflake for analytics, replacing Postgres.

**Analysis:**
- **Architecture**: 
  - Sequential flow: Event Hub ingests data, MongoDB stores it operationally, and data is then extracted and loaded into Snowflake for analytics.
  - MongoDB acts as the operational database, while Snowflake serves as the analytical database.
  - Requires an ETL process to move data from MongoDB to Snowflake, similar to Pipeline #1’s Mongo-to-Postgres flow.
- **Performance**: 
  - MongoDB efficiently handles high-throughput, schema-flexible IoT data from Event Hub.
  - Snowflake excels at analytical queries, offering superior performance for large-scale, complex analytics compared to Postgres.
  - The ETL process from MongoDB to Snowflake introduces latency, depending on the frequency (batch vs. near real-time) and complexity of transformations.
- **Cost**: 
  - MongoDB costs depend on the deployment (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas).
  - Snowflake costs include storage (per TB/month) and compute (credits/hour), which can be optimized with auto-scaling and auto-suspend.
  - ETL processes (e.g., using Azure Data Factory) add compute and data movement costs, similar to Pipeline #1.
  - Compared to Pipeline #1, replacing Postgres with Snowflake may increase costs due to Snowflake’s pricing model but eliminates Postgres-related costs.
- **Scalability**: 
  - MongoDB scales horizontally for write-heavy IoT workloads.
  - Snowflake’s separation of compute and storage ensures high scalability for analytical workloads, outperforming Postgres in Pipeline #1.
  - The ETL process may become a bottleneck if not optimized for large data volumes.
- **Complexity**: 
  - Similar to Pipeline #1, managing two databases (MongoDB and Snowflake) and an ETL pipeline increases operational overhead.
  - Less complex than Pipeline #2 (no Blob Storage), but more complex than Pipeline #3 (no direct streaming to Snowflake).
  - ETL requires schema mapping and transformation from MongoDB’s flexible schema to Snowflake’s structured schema.
- **Data Consistency**: 
  - The ETL process risks data inconsistencies or delays if not carefully managed (e.g., schema mismatches or failures in data transfer).
  - Similar to Pipeline #1, but Snowflake’s robust data integrity features (e.g., ACID compliance) mitigate some risks compared to Postgres.
- **Alignment with Goal**: Fully aligns with the goal by eliminating Postgres and using Snowflake for analytics.

**Summary**: Pipeline #4 is a straightforward replacement of Postgres with Snowflake in the current architecture. It leverages MongoDB for operational storage and Snowflake for analytics but inherits the complexity and latency of an ETL process, similar to Pipeline #1.

### **Comparison with Previous Pipelines**

| **Criteria**           | **Pipeline #1 (Mongo -> Postgres)** | **Pipeline #2 (Mongo & Blob -> Snowflake)** | **Pipeline #3 (Mongo & Snowflake)** | **Pipeline #4 (Mongo -> Snowflake)** |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**       | MQTT -> Event Hub -> Mongo -> Postgres | MQTT -> Event Hub -> (Mongo & Blob) -> Snowflake | MQTT -> Event Hub -> (Mongo & Snowflake) | MQTT -> Event Hub -> Mongo -> Snowflake |
| **Performance**        | Moderate (Postgres limits analytics, ETL latency) | Good (Blob adds latency, Snowflake excels) | Best (Near real-time, no Blob latency) | Good (ETL latency, Snowflake excels) |

### **Detailed Comparison**
- **Vs. Pipeline #1 (Mongo -> Postgres)**:
  - **Similarities**: Both use a sequential architecture (Mongo -> analytical database) with an ETL process.
  - **Differences**: 
    - Pipeline #4 replaces Postgres with Snowflake, aligning with the goal.
    - Snowflake offers better analytical performance and scalability than Postgres.
    - Costs may shift (Snowflake’s compute/storage vs. Postgres’s instance-based pricing), with Snowflake potentially more expensive for heavy analytics but more efficient for large-scale queries.
    - Complexity remains similar due to the ETL process, but Snowflake’s managed nature reduces some database administration overhead compared to Postgres.
  - **Conclusion**: Pipeline #4 is a direct improvement over Pipeline #1, achieving the goal of using Snowflake while maintaining a similar architecture.

- **Vs. Pipeline #2 (Mongo & Blob -> Snowflake)**:
  - **Similarities**: Both use MongoDB for operational storage and Snowflake for analytics, aligning with the goal.
  - **Differences**: 
    - Pipeline #4 eliminates Blob Storage, simplifying the architecture and reducing storage costs.
    - Pipeline #2’s parallel writes to MongoDB and Blob Storage avoid sequential ETL latency between MongoDB and Snowflake, but Blob-to-Snowflake ETL introduces its own latency.
    - Pipeline #4’s sequential ETL (Mongo -> Snowflake) may be simpler to manage than Pipeline #2’s three-system setup but risks similar latency.
    - Pipeline #2 is better for scenarios requiring a data lake (e.g., archiving or multi-format data storage), while Pipeline #4 is more streamlined.
  - **Conclusion**: Pipeline #4 is simpler and potentially cheaper (no Blob Storage), but Pipeline #2 is better for data lake use cases or when parallel ingestion is preferred.

- **Vs. Pipeline #3 (Mongo & Snowflake)**:
  - **Similarities**: Both use MongoDB and Snowflake, aligning with the goal.
  - **Differences**: 
    - Pipeline #3 sends data directly to both MongoDB and Snowflake in parallel, avoiding ETL latency and simplifying the architecture.
    - Pipeline #4’s sequential flow (Mongo -> Snowflake) introduces ETL latency and complexity, similar to Pipeline #1.
    - Pipeline #3 requires streaming setup (e.g., Snowflake Kafka connector or Snowpipe), which may be complex but eliminates ETL overhead.
    - Pipeline #3 may have higher Snowflake compute costs for streaming but avoids ETL pipeline costs (e.g., Azure Data Factory).
  - **Conclusion**: Pipeline #3 is superior in performance (near real-time) and simplicity (no ETL), but Pipeline #4 may be easier to implement if you’re already familiar with Mongo-to-Postgres ETL processes.

---

### **Recommendation**
**Pipeline #3** remains the best choice from the previous comparison due to its simplicity, near-real-time performance, and elimination of ETL overhead. However, **Pipeline #4** is a viable alternative if:
- You prefer a sequential architecture similar to your current setup (Pipeline #1), leveraging existing ETL expertise.
- Real-time analytics is not critical, and batch ETL from MongoDB to Snowflake is acceptable.
- You want to avoid the complexity of setting up direct streaming to Snowflake (e.g., Kafka connector or Snowpipe).

**Comparison to Pipeline #4**:
- **Pipeline #4** is a direct evolution of your current pipeline (Pipeline #1), replacing Postgres with Snowflake while maintaining the same structure. It’s easier to transition to if you’re accustomed to Mongo-to-Postgres ETL processes.
- However, it inherits the same drawbacks as Pipeline #1: ETL latency, complexity, and potential data consistency issues.
- Compared to Pipeline #3, Pipeline #4 is less performant (due to ETL latency) and more complex (due to ETL management) but may be easier to implement if streaming to Snowflake is not feasible.

**Action Steps for Pipeline #4**:
1. Reuse existing Mongo-to-Postgres ETL logic, adapting it for Snowflake (e.g., using Azure Data Factory or Snowflake’s COPY command).
2. Define schema mappings from MongoDB’s flexible schema to Snowflake’s structured tables, handling IoT data variability.
3. Optimize ETL frequency (e.g., batch vs. micro-batch) based on latency requirements.
4. Monitor Snowflake compute costs and optimize with auto-scaling/auto-suspend.
5. Compare costs using Azure and Snowflake pricing calculators, factoring in ETL (e.g., Data Factory) and Snowflake compute/storage.

**When to Choose Pipeline #4**:
- If transitioning from Pipeline #1 and you want minimal changes to the existing architecture.
- If real-time analytics is not a priority, and batch processing is sufficient.
- If your team lacks expertise in streaming setups (e.g., Snowflake Kafka connector).

**When to Prefer Pipeline #3**:
- If near-real-time analytics is critical.
- If you want to minimize complexity by eliminating ETL processes.
- If you can invest in configuring streaming ingestion to Snowflake.

**Memory Integration**: Based on your prior question about transferring data from MQTT to Snowflake on Azure (July 29, 2025), Pipeline #4 aligns with a sequential approach you may have considered, but Pipeline #3 was likely recommended for its direct streaming efficiency.

If you’re leaning toward Pipeline #4 due to familiarity with your current ETL setup, I can provide detailed guidance on adapting it for Snowflake.

Let me know if you need specific implementation details (e.g., ETL setup with Azure Data Factory, Snowflake schema design, or cost estimates) or if you want to explore Pipeline #3’s streaming setup further.




To efficiently move MongoDB collections to Snowflake, transform them into schema-optimized tables for analytics, and perform joins on large tables in Snowflake, I'll provide a comprehensive solution using Python, Azure services, and Snowflake.

The approach will leverage Azure Event Hub for data ingestion, Azure Data Factory (ADF) or Python for ETL, and Snowflake for analytics. I'll also address unrolling MongoDB’s JSON-like documents into a relational schema suitable for Snowflake and optimizing joins for large tables.

### **Solution Overview**
1. **Data Movement**: Extract data from MongoDB and load it into Snowflake, using Azure Data Factory for orchestration or Python for a custom ETL pipeline.
2. **Transformation**: Unroll MongoDB’s nested JSON documents into a flattened, relational schema optimized for Snowflake’s columnar storage and analytical queries.
3. **Joins in Snowflake**: Optimize Snowflake queries for joining large tables, leveraging Snowflake’s scalability and best practices.
4. **Assumptions**:
   - MongoDB collections contain IoT data (e.g., sensor readings with nested JSON structures).
   - Data is ingested via Azure Event Hub, stored in MongoDB, and needs to be moved to Snowflake.
   - Snowflake is configured in your Azure environment with appropriate credentials.
   - The goal is to enable efficient analytics queries (e.g., aggregations, time-series analysis).

Below is the detailed implementation, including Python code for ETL, schema transformation, and Snowflake query optimization.

### **Explanation of the Code and Process**

#### **1. Data Movement from MongoDB to Snowflake**
- **Tooling**: The Python script uses `pymongo` to connect to MongoDB, `snowflake-connector-python` and `snowflake-sqlalchemy` to interact with Snowflake, and `pandas` for data transformation and loading.
- **Process**:
  - **Extract**: Connect to MongoDB and fetch documents from the specified collection using `find()`.
  - **Transform**: Unroll nested JSON documents into a flat structure (see below).
  - **Load**: Use pandas to load transformed data into Snowflake via SQLAlchemy, which supports efficient bulk inserts.
  - **Batch Processing**: Process data in batches (default: 1000 documents) to optimize memory usage and performance.
- **Alternative with Azure Data Factory**:
  - Configure an ADF pipeline with a **MongoDB connector** to extract data and a **Snowflake connector** to load it.
  - Use ADF’s **Copy Activity** to move data, with a staging area (e.g., Azure Blob Storage) for large datasets.
  - Transformations can be handled in ADF’s **Data Flow** or a separate Python script (as above).
  - Example ADF pipeline configuration (JSON):

```json

{
    "name": "MongoToSnowflakePipeline",
    "properties": {
        "activities": [
            {
                "name": "CopyMongoToSnowflake",
                "type": "Copy",
                "inputs": [
                    {
                        "referenceName": "MongoDBDataset",
                        "type": "DatasetReference"
                    }
                ],
                "outputs": [
                    {
                        "referenceName": "SnowflakeDataset",
                        "type": "DatasetReference"
                    }
                ],
                "typeProperties": {
                    "source": {
                        "type": "MongoDbSource",
                        "query": "db.<mongo_collection>.find()"
                    },
                    "sink": {
                        "type": "SnowflakeSink",
                        "writeBatchSize": 10000
                    },
                    "enableStaging": true,
                    "stagingSettings": {
                        "linkedServiceName": {
                            "referenceName": "AzureBlobStorage",
                            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
                        },
                        "path": "staging/container"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}

```

- **Efficiency Tips**:
  - Use Snowflake’s **Snowpipe** for near-real-time ingestion if data is streamed from Event Hub to MongoDB.
  - Compress data (e.g., Parquet format) when staging in Blob Storage to reduce transfer times.
  - Tune batch size (`batch_size` in the script) based on memory and network constraints.

#### **2. Transforming MongoDB Collections**
- **MongoDB Data Structure**: IoT data in MongoDB is typically nested JSON (e.g., sensor readings with embedded metadata). Example:
  ```json
  {
      "_id": "123",
      "device_id": "sensor_001",
      "timestamp": ISODate("2025-08-04T12:00:00Z"),
      "readings": {
          "temperature": 25.5,
          "humidity": 60,
          "metadata": {
              "location": "room_1",
              "unit": "C"
          }
      }
  }
  ```
- **Transformation Approach**:
  - **Unroll Nested JSON**: Flatten the structure to a relational format suitable for Snowflake’s columnar storage. The `transform_document` function in the script converts the nested JSON into a flat dictionary:
    ```python
    {
        "id": "123",
        "device_id": "sensor_001",
        "timestamp": "2025-08-04 12:00:00",
        "temperature": 25.5,
        "humidity": 60,
        "location": "room_1",
        "unit": "C"
    }
    ```
  - **Schema Optimization for Analytics**:
    - Use **VARCHAR** for identifiers (`id`, `device_id`, `location`, `unit`) to handle variable-length strings.
    - Use **TIMESTAMP_NTZ** for `timestamp` to store time-series data without timezone (IoT data typically uses UTC).
    - Use **FLOAT** for numerical values (`temperature`, `humidity`) to support aggregations and analytics.
    - Add an `ingestion_time` column (default: `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`) for auditing and tracking ETL runs.
    - Define a **PRIMARY KEY** on `id` for uniqueness and query optimization.
    - Use **CLUSTER BY (device_id, timestamp)** to optimize time-series queries and joins, as IoT data is often queried by device and time range.
- **Handling Variability**:
  - If MongoDB documents have varying schemas (e.g., missing fields), the script filters out `None` values to avoid null-related errors in Snowflake.
  - For complex nested arrays (e.g., multiple readings per document), consider creating separate tables (e.g., `sensor_readings`) and joining them with the main table using foreign keys.
  - Example for arrays:
    ```json
    {
        "_id": "123",
        "device_id": "sensor_001",
        "readings": [
            {"type": "temperature", "value": 25.5, "unit": "C"},
            {"type": "humidity", "value": 60, "unit": "%"}
        ]
    }
    ```
    Transform into a separate table:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE sensor_readings (
        id VARCHAR(50),
        device_id VARCHAR(50),
        reading_type VARCHAR(50),
        value FLOAT,
        unit VARCHAR(10),
        FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES sensor_data(id)
    );
    ```
    The script can be extended to handle arrays by creating multiple records per document.

#### **3. Joining Large Tables in Snowflake**
- **Scenario**: Assume two large tables in Snowflake:
  - `sensor_data`: Contains device readings (as above).
  - `device_info`: Contains device metadata (e.g., `device_id`, `model`, `installation_date`).
  - Example `device_info` table:

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE device_info (
    device_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    model VARCHAR(100),
    installation_date DATE,
    location VARCHAR(100)
)
CLUSTER BY (device_id);

```

- **Join Optimization**:
  - **Clustering Keys**: Both tables are clustered by `device_id` (and `timestamp` for `sensor_data`) to co-locate related data, reducing data scanning during joins.
  - **Join Query Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        s.device_id,
        s.timestamp,
        s.temperature,
        s.humidity,
        d.model,
        d.installation_date
    FROM sensor_data s
    INNER JOIN device_info d
        ON s.device_id = d.device_id
    WHERE s.timestamp BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-04'
    AND s.device_id IN ('sensor_001', 'sensor_002');
    ```
  - **Best Practices**:
    - **Filter Early**: Apply `WHERE` clauses before joins to reduce the dataset (e.g., filter by `timestamp` or `device_id`).
    - **Use Appropriate Join Types**: Use `INNER JOIN` for strict matches, as it’s more efficient than `LEFT` or `FULL` joins.
    - **Leverage Snowflake’s Scalability**: Use a larger warehouse (e.g., `MEDIUM` or `LARGE`) for joins on massive tables to parallelize compute.
    - **Partition Pruning**: The `CLUSTER BY` on `device_id` and `timestamp` ensures Snowflake prunes irrelevant partitions during queries.
    - **Materialized Views**: For frequently joined datasets, consider creating a materialized view to pre-compute joins:
      ```sql
      CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sensor_device_mv AS
      SELECT 
          s.device_id,
          s.timestamp,
          s.temperature,
          s.humidity,
          d.model,
          d.installation_date
      FROM sensor_data s
      INNER JOIN device_info d
          ON s.device_id = d.device_id;
      ```
    - **Query Profiling**: Use Snowflake’s Query Profile to identify bottlenecks (e.g., data skew, excessive scanning) and adjust clustering or warehouse size.
    - **Avoid Over-Joining**: Limit joins to necessary tables and columns to reduce compute costs.

#### **4. Deployment and Automation**
- **Azure Data Factory**:
  - Schedule the ADF pipeline (`adf_pipeline.json`) to run periodically (e.g., hourly or daily) using ADF triggers.
  - Monitor pipeline runs for errors and performance using ADF’s monitoring dashboard.
- **Python Script**:
  - Deploy the Python script (`mongo_to_snowflake_etl.py`) on an Azure Function or Azure Batch for serverless or batch execution.
  - Use Azure Event Hub triggers to process new MongoDB data in near real-time, updating the script to listen for inserts via MongoDB change streams:
    ```python
    change_stream = mongo_collection.watch()
    for change in change_stream:
        transformed_doc = transform_document(change['fullDocument'])
        if transformed_doc:
            load_to_snowflake([transformed_doc], get_snowflake_engine())
    ```
- **Error Handling**:
  - Log errors (as implemented in the script) and set up alerts in Azure Monitor or Snowflake.
  - Handle schema evolution (e.g., new fields in MongoDB) by dynamically updating Snowflake tables or using `VARIANT` columns temporarily.

#### **5. Cost and Performance Optimization**
- **Snowflake**:
  - Use **auto-suspend** and **auto-resume** to minimize compute costs.
  - Choose an appropriate warehouse size based on data volume (e.g., `XSMALL` for testing, `MEDIUM` for production).
  - Compress data before loading (e.g., Parquet) to reduce storage costs.
- **MongoDB**: Use indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., `device_id`, `timestamp`) to speed up extraction.
- **ETL**: Optimize batch size and frequency to balance latency and cost. For near-real-time, use Snowpipe or MongoDB change streams.
- **Joins**: Monitor Snowflake credit usage for large joins and scale the warehouse dynamically.

---

### **Additional Notes**
- **Security**:
  - Secure MongoDB and Snowflake credentials using Azure Key Vault.
  - Use Azure Private Link for Snowflake to ensure secure data transfer.
  - Encrypt data in transit and at rest (Snowflake and Azure Blob Storage provide this by default).
- **Schema Evolution**:
  - If MongoDB documents change frequently, consider using Snowflake’s `VARIANT` column to store semi-structured data temporarily, then transform it into relational tables via Snowflake SQL:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE raw_sensor_data (
        id VARCHAR(50),
        raw_json VARIANT
    );
    SELECT 
        raw_json:device_id::VARCHAR AS device_id,
        raw_json:timestamp::TIMESTAMP_NTZ AS timestamp,
        raw_json:readings.temperature::FLOAT AS temperature
    FROM raw_sensor_data;
    ```
- **Testing**:
  - Test the ETL pipeline with a small dataset to validate schema and performance.
  - Use Snowflake’s `EXPLAIN` plan to optimize queries and joins.

---

### **Memory Integration**
Based on our prior conversation (August 4, 2025), you requested a comparison of pipelines, with **Pipeline #4 (MQTT -> Event Hub -> Mongo -> Snowflake)** being the closest to this implementation. The provided code aligns with that architecture, offering a sequential ETL process from MongoDB to Snowflake. If you prefer **Pipeline #3 (Mongo & Snowflake)** for near-real-time ingestion, I can modify the script to use MongoDB change streams and Snowflake Snowpipe for direct streaming.

Let me know if you need:
- Modifications for real-time ingestion (e.g., Snowpipe or Kafka connector).
- Detailed Azure Data Factory configuration steps.
- Additional Snowflake query examples for specific analytics use cases.
- Cost estimation based on your data volume and query patterns.

## 1. Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) Pipeline Overview

MongoDB (nested JSON, arrays)
    |
    |  [Extract & Flatten]
    v
Intermediate Flat Format (Parquet/CSV)
    |
    |  [Load to Snowflake - staged]
    v
Snowflake (transformed schema optimized for JOINs, filters, aggregations)

## 2. Tools & Tech Stack

- Language: Python (with `pymongo`, `pandas`, `snowflake-connector-python`)
- Flattening: `json_normalize` or custom flattening
- Staging Format: Parquet (preferred), or CSV
- Snowflake Load: `PUT` + `COPY INTO` from stage

## 3. Example Code

### A. Extract and Flatten MongoDB Collection

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import pandas as pd
from pandas import json_normalize

client = MongoClient("mongodb://<user>:<pass>@host:port")
db = client["your_db"]
collection = db["your_collection"]

# Fetch and flatten
cursor = collection.find()
docs = list(cursor)

# Flatten nested JSON fields
flat_docs = json_normalize(docs)

# Optional: Drop unneeded or deeply nested fields
# flat_docs.drop(columns=["some.deep.field"], inplace=True)

flat_docs.to_parquet("data.parquet", index=False)
```


### B. Upload to Snowflake Stage and Load
```python

import snowflake.connector
import os

# Snowflake connection
conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
    user='USER',
    password='PASS',
    account='ACCOUNT',
    warehouse='WAREHOUSE',
    database='DB',
    schema='SCHEMA'
)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Step 1: Create internal stage (once)
cursor.execute("CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE mongo_stage")

# Step 2: Upload file to stage
os.system("snowsql -a ACCOUNT -u USER -f put_command.sql")
# where put_command.sql contains:
# PUT file://data.parquet @mongo_stage AUTO_COMPRESS=TRUE;

# Step 3: Create destination table (flattened schema)
cursor.execute("""
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE flattened_mongo (
    field1 STRING,
    field2 NUMBER,
    date_field DATE,
    ...
)
""")

# Step 4: Copy into Snowflake table
cursor.execute("""
COPY INTO flattened_mongo
FROM @mongo_stage/data.parquet.gz
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'PARQUET')
""")
```

## 4. Schema Design in Snowflake for Analytics
Do:
- Flatten deeply nested documents (no arrays inside rows)
- Normalize large subdocuments into separate tables
- Replace arrays of subdocuments with junction tables

Example:
MongoDB Document:

```json

{
  "_id": "user1",
  "name": "Alice",
  "orders": [
    {"order_id": "o1", "amount": 100},
    {"order_id": "o2", "amount": 50}
  ]
}
```
Snowflake Schema:

```
users(_id, name)
orders(user_id, order_id, amount)
```
This denormalization allows you to:

```sql
SELECT u.name, SUM(o.amount)
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u._id = o.user_id
GROUP BY u.name
```

## 5. Best Practices for Joining Big Tables in Snowflake
Use Clustered Tables

```sql

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id STRING,
    user_id STRING,
    amount NUMBER,
    order_date DATE
)
CLUSTER BY (user_id);
```
Filter Early and Avoid Cross Joins

```sql
-- Good pattern
WITH filtered_orders AS (
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2025-01-01'
)
SELECT u.name, SUM(o.amount)
FROM filtered_orders o
JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u._id
GROUP BY u.name
```
Use HASH_JOIN() hints if needed (advanced)

```sql
SELECT /*+ HASH_JOIN(users orders) */
```

### 6. Summary

| Step         | Description                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Extract   | Use `pymongo` to read data                            |
| 2. Transform | Flatten JSON, remove arrays, normalize                |
| 3. Load      | Write to Parquet → Stage → COPY INTO Snowflake        |
| 4. Model     | Use Snowflake-friendly schema (flattened, normalized) |
| 5. Optimize  | Use cluster keys, filter early, avoid cross joins     |

Moving MongoDB Collections to SnowflakeThis guide outlines a comprehensive approach to moving data from MongoDB to Snowflake, focusing on efficiency, schema transformation for analytics, and best practices for joining large tables.1. Efficiently Moving Data from MongoDB to SnowflakeThe most efficient methods for data ingestion from MongoDB to Snowflake depend on whether you need a one-time migration or a continuous, real-time sync.

Option A: Automated ELT/CDC Tools (Recommended)For most use cases, especially those requiring real-time or near-real-time 
data, using a third-party ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) or CDC (Change Data Capture) tool is the most efficient and scalable method. These tools handle the complex details of data extraction, schema inference, and continuous synchronization.  
How it Works: Tools like Fivetran, Stitch, or Estuary connect directly to your MongoDB instance (often using MongoDB's Change Streams) and stream the data to a staging area in your cloud provider (e.g., AWS S3). 

Snowflake's Snowpipe can then automatically ingest this data as it arrives.
Benefits:Automation: No custom code is required to handle data ingestion, transformations, or schema changes.Real-time: 

CDC functionality ensures that new data and updates in MongoDB are reflected in Snowflake with low latency.Scalability: 
These platforms are designed to handle high volumes of data without performance degradation.

Option B: 
Manual Batch Processing with Custom ScriptsIf you have a one-time migration or a simple, scheduled batch process, you can build a custom data pipeline using a scripting language like Python.Extract: Use a MongoDB client library (e.g., pymongo in Python) to extract data from your collection.

Export: Export the data into a semi-structured format like JSON or Parquet.  
Stage: Upload the files to an external stage (e.g., S3, Google Cloud Storage) that is accessible by Snowflake.Load: 
Use Snowflake's COPY INTO command to load the staged files into a target table.

Example: Loading a JSON File into SnowflakeFirst, create a target table in Snowflake with a VARIANT column to hold the raw JSON. This is crucial for maintaining the original data structure before transformation.

```sql
-- Step 1: Create a staging table with a VARIANT column

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE raw_mongo_data (
    raw_document VARIANT
);

-- Step 2: Create a named external stage (if you haven't already)

CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE my_s3_stage
  URL = 's3://my-bucket/path/to/mongo-data/'
  CREDENTIALS = (AWS_KEY_ID = 'your_key_id' AWS_SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key');

-- Step 3: Use COPY INTO to load the data from your stage

COPY INTO raw_mongo_data
FROM @my_s3_stage
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'JSON');
```

2. Schema Transformation for Analytics (Unrolling JSON)
   This is the most critical step. MongoDB's flexible schema needs to be flattened into a relational structure to unlock Snowflake's full analytical power.  
   The key is to use Snowflake's FLATTEN and LATERAL functions.The best practice is to load the raw JSON into a staging table and then create views or new tables with a flattened schema for your analytical workloads.

   How to Flatten Nested DocumentsLet's assume your MongoDB collection has a nested document like this:
```
   {
  "_id": "user123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "contact": {
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "555-1234"
  }
}
```
You can flatten this into a relational table using dot notation:CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW users_contact_view AS
```sql
SELECT
    raw_document:_id::VARCHAR AS user_id,
    raw_document:name::VARCHAR AS user_name,
    raw_document:contact.email::VARCHAR AS email,
    raw_document:contact.phone::VARCHAR AS phone_number
FROM raw_mongo_data;
```
How to Flatten Arrays (Unroll JSON)If your document contains an array, like a list of orders, you need to "unroll" it into multiple rows. This is where FLATTEN and LATERAL come in.

Consider a document with a nested items array:
```json
{
  "_id": "order456",
  "order_date": "2025-07-28",
  "customer_id": "cust789",
  "items": [
    { "product_id": "prod_a", "quantity": 2, "price": 10.00 },
    { "product_id": "prod_b", "quantity": 1, "price": 25.50 }
  ]
}
```
You can transform this into a relational fact table (orders_items_fact) where each row represents a single item in an order.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW orders_items_fact AS
SELECT
    raw_document:_id::VARCHAR AS order_id,
    raw_document:order_date::DATE AS order_date,
    raw_document:customer_id::VARCHAR AS customer_id,
    item.value:product_id::VARCHAR AS product_id,
    item.value:quantity::NUMBER AS quantity,
    item.value:price::NUMBER AS price
FROM raw_mongo_data,
LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => raw_document:items) AS item;

```
This LATERAL FLATTEN statement creates a new row for each item in the items array, effectively "unrolling" the JSON.

3. Joining Large Tables in SnowflakeOnce your data is in a flattened, relational structure, you can leverage Snowflake's powerful query engine. However, for large tables, you should follow these best practices for optimal performance.

#### A. Filter EarlyAlways filter your data before performing a JOIN. 
This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed, leading to significant performance gains.
-- Bad: Filters after the join

```sql
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    c.customer_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2025-01-01';

-- Good: Filters before the join
WITH filtered_orders AS (
    SELECT order_id, customer_id
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date >= '2025-01-01'
)
SELECT
    fo.order_id,
    c.customer_name
FROM filtered_orders fo
JOIN customers c ON fo.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```
#### B. Use Clustering KeysFor very large tables (over 1 TB) that are frequently queried on a specific set of columns, consider defining a clustering key. 
A clustering key ensures that data with similar values is stored physically close together, which can drastically improve query performance by enabling "query pruning."

Example: If your sales table is often queried by order_date and customer_id, you could define a clustering key on these columns.

ALTER TABLE sales_fact CLUSTER BY (order_date, customer_id);

Note: Clustering adds maintenance costs, so it should only be used on tables where it provides a significant benefit for your most critical queries.

#### C. Leverage Search Optimization ServiceFor join predicates on columns with low cardinality (a small number of distinct values), enabling the Search Optimization Service can improve performance. It creates a persistent data structure that allows for faster lookups.

Example: If you frequently join your sales table with a products table on product_id, you can enable search optimization on that column.

ALTER TABLE sales_fact ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON EQUALITY(product_id);

#### D. Use JOIN with Primary and Foreign KeysWhile Snowflake doesn't enforce primary and foreign key constraints, defining them is a best practice. It helps the query optimizer understand the relationships between tables and can be used by business intelligence tools to build queries more efficiently.-- Define primary and foreign key constraints as "informational"

ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT PK_ORDER_ID PRIMARY KEY (order_id);  
ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT FK_CUSTOMER_ID FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id);

By following these steps, you can create a robust and efficient data pipeline that moves your MongoDB data into a format optimized for analytics in Snowflake.
