## 🔁 Option 1: Periodic Full Extract (recommended for small/moderate collections)

### 🔧 Steps:
1. **Create a Linked Service** to MongoDB in ADF using the **MongoDB Atlas connector** or via **Self-hosted Integration Runtime** (if on-prem).
2. **Create a Dataset** for each MongoDB collection.
3. **Build a Pipeline** with:
   - **Copy Activity**: from MongoDB to ADLS Gen2.
   - Set **source query** if you want incremental behavior using a `lastModified` timestamp field.
4. **Configure Schedule Trigger**: run every 5m / 1h / daily, depending on freshness needs.
5. **Store in ADLS Gen2**: use Parquet or JSON format.



In the context of MongoDB → ADLS Gen2 via Azure Data Factory,  
here's how you can generally classify small to moderate collections:


| Category     | Document Count    | Data Volume per Collection | Recommended ADF Mode                     |
| ------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Small**    | < 1 million docs  | < 1 GB                     | Periodic full extract ✅                  |
| **Moderate** | 1–10 million docs | 1–10 GB                    | Periodic full extract ✅                  |
| **Large**    | > 10 million docs | > 10 GB                    | Change streams or incremental extract ⚠️ |

Considerations Beyond Size
1. Change Frequency
If a collection updates very frequently (e.g., > 5% of docs/hour), full extract might cause high I/O or outdated snapshots.

2. Index Availability
If collections have an indexed updated_at or _id field, you can use incremental extract even for moderate/large datasets.

3. Network & Runtime Limits
ADF copy activities may timeout or throttle if transferring multi-GB unindexed documents frequently.

4. Downstream Consumers
If consumers (e.g., Snowflake, Synapse) are only interested in deltas or aggregates, a full extract wastes resources.


Periodic Full Extract is fine if:

- Collection is < 10 GB
- Extract takes < 15 minutes per collection
- Changes are not extremely frequent
- Otherwise, use Change Streams or incremental lastModified-based sync


---

## ⚙️ Option 2: Incremental Loads Using Change Streams (for real-time/delta sync)

### ✅ When to use Change Streams:
Use **MongoDB Change Streams** **only if**:
- You need **near-real-time** updates.
- Your MongoDB version supports replica sets and change streams.
- You need to track inserts, updates, and deletes incrementally.

### 🔧 How:
ADF **does not natively support Change Streams**, so you would:

1. Build a **custom app** (Python, Node.js, etc.) that:
   - Subscribes to MongoDB change streams.
   - Writes the change events to **ADLS Gen2** or to a queue (e.g., Azure Event Hub or Kafka).
2. Use **ADF or Azure Data Explorer** to batch process those events from ADLS or the queue.

> ⚠️ Change Streams are powerful but add operational complexity. Prefer periodic batch if the freshness requirement allows.

## 📁 Folder Layout in ADLS Gen2

To ensure clarity, traceability, and partitioning for downstream use, follow this layout:

```
/mongo_export/
  └── <collection_name>/
        └── year=<yyyy>/
              └── month=<mm>/
                    └── day=<dd>/
                          └── hour=<hh>/ (optional if high-frequency)
                            └── export_<timestamp>.parquet
```

### 🔁 Example:
```
/mongo_export/users/year=2025/month=08/day=06/users_20250806T140000.parquet
/mongo_export/orders/year=2025/month=08/day=06/orders_20250806T140000.parquet
```

This structure:
- Supports **partition pruning**.
- Keeps historical snapshots for **auditing/versioning**.
- Scales well for downstream **Spark/Snowflake/Synapse** queries.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Feature | Periodic Copy | Change Streams |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Ease of setup** | ✅ Very easy (ADF GUI) | ❌ Custom coding required |
| **Latency** | ❌ Depends on schedule (e.g., hourly) | ✅ Near real-time |
| **Scalability** | ✅ Scales with partitions | ⚠️ Need to manage scaling manually |
| **Best for** | Snapshots, audit, historical loads | Real-time sync, low-latency apps |

## 🧩 Part 1: Node.js App – MongoDB Change Stream → ADLS Gen2

This app:
- Connects to MongoDB change stream
- Buffers change events
- Uploads them as JSON files to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)

### 🔧 Requirements
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install mongodb @azure/storage-blob uuid dotenv
```

### 📁 `.env` file (local config)
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true&w=majority
CONTAINER_NAME=changestream
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=xxx;AccountKey=xxx;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net
```

### 📜 `app.js`
```js
require('dotenv').config();
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const { BlobServiceClient } = require('@azure/storage-blob');
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');
const fs = require('fs');

const MONGO_URI = process.env.MONGO_URI;
const AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING = process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING;
const CONTAINER_NAME = process.env.CONTAINER_NAME;

const client = new MongoClient(MONGO_URI);
const blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING);
const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(CONTAINER_NAME);

const buffer = [];
const MAX_BUFFER_SIZE = 100; // number of events
const FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS = 60_000; // 1 minute

async function uploadToADLS(events) {
  const fileName = `changes/${new Date().toISOString()}_${uuidv4()}.json`;
  const blobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(fileName);
  const jsonData = JSON.stringify(events, null, 2);
  await blobClient.upload(jsonData, Buffer.byteLength(jsonData));
  console.log(`Uploaded ${events.length} events to ADLS: ${fileName}`);
}

async function run() {
  await client.connect();
  const db = client.db(); // default
  const collection = db.collection('your_collection');

  const changeStream = collection.watch();

  // Periodic flushing
  setInterval(async () => {
    if (buffer.length > 0) {
      const toUpload = buffer.splice(0, buffer.length);
      await uploadToADLS(toUpload);
    }
  }, FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS);

  changeStream.on('change', async (change) => {
    buffer.push(change);

    if (buffer.length >= MAX_BUFFER_SIZE) {
      const toUpload = buffer.splice(0, buffer.length);
      await uploadToADLS(toUpload);
    }
  });

  console.log('Listening to change stream...');
}

run().catch(console.error);
```

## 🧩 Part 2: ADF Pipeline – Load JSON from ADLS → Snowflake

### 💠 Source: ADLS Gen2
- Linked service: Azure Blob Storage (ADLS Gen2)
- Dataset: JSON files from `changestream/` folder

### 💠 Sink: Snowflake
- Linked service: Snowflake (with proper credentials)
- Option 1: Use **Snowflake COPY command** (recommended for batched loads)
- Option 2: Use **Snowpipe** via external stage + notification

---

### 🏗️ ADF Pipeline Activities

1. **Get Metadata / List Files**
   - Enumerate JSON files under `changestream/`

2. **ForEach Activity**
   - Loop over listed files

3. **Copy Activity**
   - Source: ADLS JSON file
   - Sink: Snowflake table
   - Use a staging table and handle `MERGE`/`UPSERT` in a later step if needed

---

## 🚀 Optional: Use Snowpipe + Event Grid

- Enable **Event Grid** on ADLS container
- Snowflake listens to new blob events via Snowpipe REST endpoint
- Automatically triggers ingest without ADF

---

## ✅ Summary

- Node.js app captures real-time changes → writes them to ADLS as batch JSON
- ADF picks up new files → loads into Snowflake in batch
- You can tune frequency, buffer size, and file layout for optimization

#  Snowflake 

To trigger a process in Snowflake right after JSON files are uploaded to ADLS Gen2 and ingested via Snowpipe, and to extract specific JSON attributes into another table, you can follow this design:
 

## ✅ Overview

```
MongoDB → Node.js → ADLS Gen2 → Snowpipe → Raw JSON Table → Post-ingestion Procedure → Parsed Table
```

---

## 🔄 Trigger Process After JSON Ingestion

### 🔧 Option 1: Use Snowpipe with Notification + TASK

If using **Snowpipe with Event Grid** (recommended for automation), then:
1. Files are automatically loaded into a **raw landing table**.
2. Use a **Snowflake `TASK`** to:
   - Monitor new rows in the raw table.
   - Extract JSON attributes.
   - Insert into a **structured target table**.

---

## 🏗️ Table Design

### 🔹 Raw Table (loaded via Snowpipe)
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE raw_mongo_data (
  file_name STRING,
  load_time TIMESTAMP,
  data VARIANT  -- entire JSON object
);
```

### 🔹 Parsed Table
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE parsed_events (
  _id STRING,
  operationType STRING,
  ns STRUCT<db STRING, coll STRING>,
  fullDocument STRUCT<field1 STRING, field2 INT, ...>,
  ts TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

## ⚙️ Sample TASK + SQL Extract

### 1. Stored Procedure
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE extract_json_to_structured()
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
  INSERT INTO parsed_events (_id, operationType, ns, fullDocument, ts)
  SELECT
    data:_id::STRING,
    data:operationType::STRING,
    OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('db', data:ns.db, 'coll', data:ns.coll),
    data:fullDocument,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
  FROM raw_mongo_data
  WHERE processed IS NULL;

  UPDATE raw_mongo_data
  SET processed = TRUE
  WHERE processed IS NULL;

  RETURN 'done';
$$;
```

### 2. Scheduled or Event-Driven

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK run_json_extraction
  WAREHOUSE = my_wh
  SCHEDULE = '1 MINUTE'
AS
  CALL extract_json_to_structured();
```

You can also trigger it manually or via Snowpipe event subscription.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Add a `processed` or `status` column to `raw_mongo_data` to avoid duplicate processing.
- Use `VARIANT` for flexible schema evolution in raw table.
- Index/cluster `parsed_events` on key columns for fast queries.
- If the data is deeply nested, consider flattening arrays using `LATERAL FLATTEN`.

# Gemini: load data from MongoDB to Snowflake

You can periodically load data from MongoDB to Snowflake on Azure using a few primary methods, each with a different level of complexity and control. The most common and recommended approach involves a staging area in Azure Blob Storage and Snowflake's data loading features.

### 1. Staging Data in Azure Blob Storage

This method is a robust and scalable solution that uses native cloud services.

* **Export from MongoDB:** Periodically export your MongoDB collections into a file format like **JSON** or **Parquet**. Since MongoDB's data is schemaless, these formats are ideal for handling nested documents. You can use MongoDB's native tools like `mongoexport` or a custom script.
* **Move to Azure Blob Storage:** Transfer the exported files to a designated container in **Azure Blob Storage**. This acts as a staging area.
* **Automate with Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Azure Data Factory is an excellent tool for orchestrating this process. It can be configured to:
    * Connect to your MongoDB instance as a source.
    * Extract the data.
    * Land it in Azure Blob Storage.
    * Trigger the next step in the pipeline.
* **Ingest with Snowflake's Snowpipe:** **Snowpipe** is Snowflake's continuous data ingestion service. It uses a **COPY INTO** command that can automatically load data from files staged in Azure Blob Storage into your Snowflake tables. You can configure it to listen for notifications from Azure Event Grid whenever a new file arrives in the blob storage, triggering an automatic data load.

---

### 2. Using an ETL/ELT Platform

For a more streamlined, low-code/no-code approach, you can use a third-party Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) or Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) tool.

* **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Many modern platforms support **Change Data Capture (CDC)** for MongoDB. This is a highly efficient method that captures only the changes made to your data (inserts, updates, and deletes) instead of a full data refresh. This significantly reduces the amount of data transferred and lowers latency.
* **Popular Tools:** Tools like **Fivetran**, **Rivery**, **Hevo Data**, and **Airbyte** have pre-built connectors for both MongoDB and Snowflake. These platforms handle the entire pipeline, including data extraction, schema flattening (a critical step for moving from a NoSQL to a relational database like Snowflake), and loading, often in near-real-time. They are particularly useful for handling complex, nested MongoDB documents.

---

### Key Considerations

* **Schema Evolution:** MongoDB is schemaless, while Snowflake is a relational database. When you load MongoDB data, you'll need to decide how to handle its flexible structure. You can load the entire JSON document into a **VARIANT** column in Snowflake and then use SQL to flatten the data, or use an ETL tool to flatten the schema during the loading process.
* **Data Volume and Latency:** For large volumes of data where near-real-time updates are needed, using a CDC-based approach with an ELT tool or Snowpipe is the most effective. For smaller, less-frequently updated collections, a scheduled batch process via Azure Data Factory might be sufficient.


Creating a full dump of a MongoDB database and writing it to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) can be accomplished with a script that leverages MongoDB's mongodump utility and Azure's command-line interface (az CLI).

### Python Script for MongoDB Dump to ADLS G2
The following Python script automates this process: it creates a dump of the specified MongoDB database, compresses it, and uploads it to ADLS G2. This can be scheduled to run periodically using a cron job (on Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows).

I'll provide you with a Python script that uses the subprocess module to run mongodump and az storage blob upload. Please make sure you have both mongodump and the Azure CLI installed and configured on the machine where you run this script.

Python Script to Dump MongoDB to ADLS G2
 

Try again without Canvas
The script first calls mongodump to create a directory containing BSON files for each collection. It then uses the az storage blob upload-batch command to upload this entire directory to a specified path within your ADLS container. Finally, it cleans up the temporary local files to save disk space.

### Performance Impact of the Dump Process
The performance impact of the mongodump process on a MongoDB instance can be significant, especially on a busy, production-level database. The process primarily affects the database's read performance and I/O resources.

Read Load: mongodump reads all data from the specified collections, which can consume a substantial amount of disk I/O. For large collections, this can cause a noticeable slowdown for other read operations.

CPU and Memory Usage: The compression (--gzip) and data processing during the dump will increase CPU and memory usage on the machine where you run mongodump, and potentially on the MongoDB server if it's on the same machine.

Locking: While mongodump is designed to be non-blocking and uses a read lock, it still can impact performance. Newer versions of mongodump use a mechanism that minimizes the time the read lock is held, but you may still see a spike in read contention, especially on a very active replica set member.

### Best Practices to Mitigate Performance Impact:
Run on a Secondary Member: The most effective way to minimize impact is to run mongodump on a secondary member of a replica set. This offloads the read-heavy operation from the primary, which is handling all write operations.

Schedule During Off-Peak Hours: Schedule your dump script to run during times when database activity is at its lowest.

Use a Smaller Batch Size: If you're writing a custom script, you can use a smaller batch size for data retrieval to reduce memory pressure. mongodump handles this automatically, but it's a good practice for custom tooling.

Isolate the Process: Run the mongodump process on a separate machine from the MongoDB server itself to prevent resource contention.

By following these practices, you can effectively manage the periodic dumping process without causing significant disruption to your live MongoDB applications.
