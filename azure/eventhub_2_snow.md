## How to get data from Azure EventHub to Snowflake?
Consider 2 scenarios: batch mode (hourly) and almost real time.
Compare the cost.


Here are the main approaches for getting data from Azure Event Hub to Snowflake, comparing batch vs real-time scenarios:

## Batch Mode (Hourly Processing)

### Option 1: Event Hub → Azure Data Lake → Snowflake
**Architecture:**
- Event Hub Capture writes data to Azure Data Lake (Parquet/Avro)
- Scheduled pipeline (Azure Data Factory/Logic Apps) runs hourly
- Pipeline loads files into Snowflake via COPY command

**Cost Factors:**
- Event Hub: ~$11/month per throughput unit
- Data Lake storage: ~$18/TB/month (cool tier)
- Data Factory: ~$1 per 1000 pipeline runs + data movement costs
- Snowflake: Warehouse costs during load operations

### Option 2: Event Hub → Azure Functions → Snowflake
**Architecture:**
- Azure Functions trigger every hour
- Function reads Event Hub data and bulk inserts to Snowflake
- Uses Snowflake's bulk loading APIs

**Cost Factors:**
- Event Hub: Same as above
- Azure Functions: ~$0.20 per million executions
- Snowflake: Warehouse compute during loads

## Near Real-Time Mode

### Option 1: Event Hub → Stream Analytics → Snowflake
**Architecture:**
- Azure Stream Analytics continuously processes Event Hub stream
- Outputs to Snowflake via REST API or staging area
- Latency: 1-5 minutes

**Cost Factors:**
- Event Hub: Same throughput unit costs
- Stream Analytics: ~$11 per streaming unit per month
- Higher Snowflake warehouse costs (always running)

### Option 2: Event Hub → Azure Functions (Event-driven) → Snowflake
**Architecture:**
- Functions triggered by Event Hub events
- Each event/batch processed immediately
- Uses Snowflake's Snowpipe for micro-batching

**Cost Factors:**
- Event Hub: Same costs
- Azure Functions: Higher execution volume = higher costs
- Snowflake: Snowpipe credits (~$1.40 per credit)

### Option 3: Event Hub → Kafka Connect → Snowflake
**Architecture:**
- Use Confluent/Azure HDInsight Kafka
- Snowflake Kafka Connector for direct streaming
- Latency: seconds to minutes

**Cost Factors:**
- Event Hub: Same costs
- Kafka cluster: $200-1000+/month depending on size
- Snowflake: Continuous warehouse usage

## Cost Comparison Example
**Assuming 1M events/day, 1KB each:**

### Batch (Hourly):
- Event Hub: $11/month
- Data Lake: $5/month storage
- Data Factory: $15/month
- Snowflake: $50/month (2 hours/day warehouse usage)
- **Total: ~$81/month**

### Real-Time:
- Event Hub: $11/month
- Stream Analytics: $11/month
- Snowflake: $200/month (continuous warehouse)
- **Total: ~$222/month**

## Recommendations

**Choose Batch when:**
- Hourly latency is acceptable
- Cost optimization is priority
- Data doesn't require immediate processing
- Simple ETL transformations needed

**Choose Real-Time when:**
- Sub-minute latency required
- Real-time alerts/dashboards needed
- Event-driven architecture preferred
- Budget allows for 2-3x higher costs

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Critical events: Real-time processing
- Bulk analytics data: Batch processing
- Use Event Hub routing to different endpoints

The batch approach is typically 60-70% cheaper but introduces latency. Real-time provides immediate data availability but requires continuous compute resources and more complex infrastructure management.
