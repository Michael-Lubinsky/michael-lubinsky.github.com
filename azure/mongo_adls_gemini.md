### How to serialize periodically  MongoDB change stream into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS v2) 
with partitioned folders like:

Partition path: db/collection/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/hour=HH/
Rolling file name: events-YYYYMMDD-HH.jsonl
with 1 json line per event

To serialize a MongoDB change stream into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS v2) with the specified partitioned folder structure, you'll need to create a data pipeline. The most common and effective way to do this is by using a combination of **MongoDB connectors**, a **message broker**, and a **data processing engine**. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set it up:

***

## 1. Capture Changes with a MongoDB Connector

The first step is to capture the change stream events from MongoDB. The most efficient way to do this is by using a **MongoDB connector for a distributed streaming platform**. 

* **Debezium:** This is an open-source distributed platform for change data capture (CDC). Debezium's MongoDB connector captures row-level changes from a MongoDB replica set or sharded cluster and streams them to a message broker.
* **MongoDB Kafka Connector:** This is a dedicated connector for Apache Kafka. It's built specifically to capture change streams and publish them as Kafka topics.

## 2. Stream Events to a Message Broker

The change events captured by the connector are then streamed to a **message broker**. This serves as a buffer and provides a reliable way to handle the data before it's written to ADLS v2.

* **Apache Kafka:** Kafka is the industry standard for this type of task. It's a high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable distributed streaming platform. The connector will publish the change events to a specific Kafka topic, with each event being a separate message.
* **Azure Event Hubs:** This is Azure's fully managed equivalent of Kafka. If your infrastructure is already in Azure, using Event Hubs can simplify management and integration.

## 3. Process and Land Data to ADLS v2

This is the most critical step, where you consume the messages from the message broker, transform them, and write them to ADLS v2 with the desired partitioning. You can use a few different tools for this:

### Option A: Apache Spark or Flink

This is the most flexible and scalable option. You'll need to write a streaming job that reads from Kafka or Event Hubs.

1.  **Read from the Topic:** The job will read messages from the specified topic, which contain the MongoDB change events.
2.  **Extract and Transform:** You'll need to parse the JSON content of each message to extract the relevant fields, such as the `db`, `collection`, and the `operationTime` or `clusterTime` timestamp.
3.  **Partitioning Logic:** Use the timestamp to calculate the `year`, `month`, `day`, and `hour`. This will dynamically create the correct folder structure.
4.  **Write to ADLS v2:** Use the `spark.sql` or `flink` API to write the data in JSON Line (JSONL) format. The output path should be constructed dynamically based on the partitioning logic: `abfss://<container_name>@<storage_account_name>.dfs.core.windows.net/db/collection/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/hour=HH/`.
5.  **Rolling File:** The Spark or Flink job can be configured to write files on a time basis (e.g., every hour) to create the `events-YYYYMMDD-HH.jsonl` files.

### Option B: Azure Data Factory (ADF)

If you prefer a low-code/no-code approach, you can use Azure Data Factory, though it may be less flexible for real-time streaming.

1.  **Trigger:** Use a tumbling window trigger to run the pipeline at a set interval (e.g., every hour).
2.  **Source:** The source will be your Kafka or Event Hubs topic.
3.  **Data Flow:** Use a Data Flow activity to consume the events. In the data flow:
    * **Parse JSON:** Parse the incoming JSON message.
    * **Derived Column:** Use derived columns to extract the date parts (`YYYY`, `MM`, `DD`, `HH`) from the timestamp field.
    * **Sink:** The sink will be your ADLS v2. Configure the sink to use the derived columns for the file path partitioning.
4.  **Partitioning:** ADF's sink settings allow you to specify dynamic content for the folder path. You can use expressions like `@formatDateTime(item().timestamp, 'yyyy/MM/dd/HH')` to create the partitioned folders automatically.

### Option C: Azure Functions

For a more custom, lightweight solution, you could write an Azure Function.

1.  **Trigger:** The function would be triggered by new messages on Event Hubs or Kafka.
2.  **Logic:** The function would consume the message, parse the JSON, and use the Azure Storage SDK to write the data to a blob in ADLS v2.
3.  **Path Construction:** The code would dynamically construct the full blob path with the partitioned folders and the rolling filename.

## Summary of the Data Flow

1.  **MongoDB** captures changes.
2.  A **Debezium/MongoDB Connector** reads these changes.
3.  The connector publishes the changes to a **Kafka/Event Hubs topic**.
4.  A **Spark/Flink job**, **ADF pipeline**, or **Azure Function** consumes the topic.
5.  The processing job transforms the data and constructs the dynamic path.
6.  The data is written to **ADLS v2** in the specified partitioned folders with the JSONL format.

This architecture ensures a scalable, reliable, and fault-tolerant way to serialize your MongoDB change stream data to ADLS v2.
