While AWS and GCP offer similar functionalities, they typically do so as separate,   
purpose-built services that you integrate yourself,  
providing more granular control but potentially higher complexity.


### Azure Equivalent of Apache Airflow Closest Equivalent:

### 1. **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**
- ADF provides **Pipelines** that orchestrate ETL/ELT workflows.
- Similar to Airflow DAGs for defining sequences of data tasks.
- GUI-based interface instead of code-first.
- Supports scheduling, monitoring, retries, dependencies.

---

## üîß Other Alternatives:

### 2. **Azure Synapse Pipelines**
- Built into **Azure Synapse Analytics**.
- Similar to ADF but tightly integrated with Synapse SQL and Spark.

### 3. **Azure Functions + Durable Functions**
- For serverless, code-driven orchestration.
- Durable Functions allow for stateful workflows like Airflow DAGs.
- Best for complex, event-driven control flows.

### 4. **Self-hosted Apache Airflow on Azure**
- Deploy on:
  - **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
  - **Azure Virtual Machines**
  - **Azure Container Instances** (with Docker)
- Gives you full Airflow flexibility on Azure infrastructure.

## üü¶ Managed Airflow on Azure?

Azure **does not** have a native managed Airflow service (unlike GCP's Cloud Composer).  
You can consider third-party managed services like:
- **Astronomer on Azure**
- **Cloud 9 Airflow deployments**
