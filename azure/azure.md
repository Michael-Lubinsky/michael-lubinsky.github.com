## Microsoft Azure â€“ Cloud Platform
 
A broad, general-purpose cloud computing platform offering hundreds of services for infrastructure, application development, data, AI, networking, and more.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) â€“ Virtual Machines, networking  
Platform as a Service (PaaS) â€“ Web Apps, Azure SQL, Kubernetes  
Data services â€“ Azure Data Lake, Azure Synapse, Cosmos DB  
AI and ML â€“ Azure OpenAI, Azure ML  
DevOps â€“ GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines  
Identity â€“ Azure AD (now Microsoft Entra ID)  

ðŸ“Œ Azure is a foundational platform for building and running any kind of application or data system in the cloud.

### Microsoft Fabric â€“ Unified Data Analytics Platform
 
A Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering built on top of Azure, 
focused on end-to-end data analytics â€” similar in vision to Databricks Lakehouse or Snowflake.

ðŸ§  Core Capabilities:
Unified platform combining:  
   Data Engineering  
   Data Warehousing  
   Real-time analytics  
   Data Science  
   Business Intelligence (Power BI)  
   OneLake â€“ centralized data lake storage (like Delta Lake or Snowflake)

Native Power BI integration
Notebook and pipeline authoring (like Azure Synapse or Databricks)
No-code/low-code experience for analysts and data scientists

ðŸ“Œ Fabric is targeted at data teams who want to perform analytics, visualization, and AI from a unified interface without managing infrastructure.
