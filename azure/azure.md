## Microsoft Azure ‚Äì Cloud Platform

<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure>
 
A broad, general-purpose cloud computing platform offering hundreds of services for infrastructure, application development, data, AI, networking, and more.

üîß Key Features:
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) ‚Äì Virtual Machines, networking  
Platform as a Service (PaaS) ‚Äì Web Apps, Azure SQL, Kubernetes  
Data services ‚Äì Azure Data Lake, Azure Synapse, Cosmos DB  
AI and ML ‚Äì Azure OpenAI, Azure ML  
DevOps ‚Äì GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines  
Identity ‚Äì Azure AD (now Microsoft Entra ID)  

üìå Azure is a foundational platform for building and running any kind of application or data system in the cloud.


### 1. Azure Blob Storage
What it is:
A scalable object storage service for storing unstructured data like images, videos, CSV files, Parquet files, backups, and logs.

üîπ Key Points:
Ideal for data lakes, backup, and archive.

Stores files in containers.

Supports hot, cool, and archive tiers for cost control.

Used by Azure Synapse, Data Factory, and others as a data source or sink.

üîß Example use cases:

Storing raw data for analytics

Hosting files for machine learning

Serving images/documents to web apps

### 2. Azure Logic Apps
What it is:
A low-code integration and automation platform to connect apps, data, and services using workflows.

üîπ Key Points:
Trigger-based execution (e.g., when a file arrives, send email).

Pre-built connectors to Office 365, SQL, Salesforce, Twitter, etc.

Uses a visual designer and can embed custom code or Azure Functions.

üîß Example use cases:

Automatically send alerts when data files land in Blob Storage

Post new SharePoint items to Microsoft Teams

Daily email reports of sales from a SQL database

###  3. Azure Data Factory (ADF)
What it is:
A cloud-based ETL/ELT orchestration tool to move, transform, and load data across systems.

üîπ Key Points:
No-code + code-based data pipelines (via GUI or JSON).

Supports on-premise and cloud data sources.

Can run Spark, SQL, or custom Python scripts.

Integrated with Azure Synapse, Databricks, Snowflake, etc.

üîß Example use cases:

Pulling data from Oracle DB and transforming it before saving to Blob or Synapse.

Automating daily data refreshes.

Combining multiple CSVs into one Parquet dataset.

###  4. Azure Synapse Analytics
What it is:
A unified data analytics platform that combines data warehousing, big data processing, and data exploration.

üîπ Key Points:
Supports T-SQL queries (dedicated pools) and Spark (serverless pools).

Integrates with Azure Data Lake, Power BI, and ADF.

Can query both structured and unstructured data.

üîß Example use cases:

Building enterprise data warehouses.

Analyzing big data using Spark notebooks.

Serving BI dashboards via Power BI.

###  5. Azure Purview (now part of Microsoft Purview)
What it is:
A data governance and data catalog service for discovering, classifying, and managing data across your organization.

üîπ Key Points:
Automatically scans data sources to extract metadata.

Builds a data catalog with lineage, classification (e.g., PII, GDPR tags).

Helps govern access, ensure compliance, and understand data usage.

üîß Example use cases:

Finding all tables containing email addresses.

Tracing where a KPI column originates in a Power BI dashboard.

Cataloging and classifying data across Azure, on-prem, and SaaS systems.

###  How They Work Together (End-to-End Pipeline):
Blob Storage: Raw sales data (CSV, JSON, Parquet) is ingested.

Data Factory: Moves and transforms data into a refined format.

Synapse Analytics: Stores data in a warehouse and enables complex queries and dashboards.

Logic Apps: Sends alerts when data fails or completes loading.

Purview: Scans the entire system to catalog and tag sensitive data.
