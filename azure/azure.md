## Microsoft Azure â€“ Cloud Platform

<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure>
 
A broad, general-purpose cloud computing platform offering hundreds of services for infrastructure, application development, data, AI, networking, and more.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) â€“ Virtual Machines, networking  
Platform as a Service (PaaS) â€“ Web Apps, Azure SQL, Kubernetes  
Data services â€“ Azure Data Lake, Azure Synapse, Cosmos DB  
AI and ML â€“ Azure OpenAI, Azure ML  
DevOps â€“ GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines  
Identity â€“ Azure AD (now Microsoft Entra ID)  

ðŸ“Œ Azure is a foundational platform for building and running any kind of application or data system in the cloud.



### 1. Azure Blob Storage
What it is:
A scalable object storage service for storing unstructured data like images, videos, CSV files, Parquet files, backups, and logs.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
Ideal for data lakes, backup, and archive.

Stores files in containers.

Supports hot, cool, and archive tiers for cost control.

Used by Azure Synapse, Data Factory, and others as a data source or sink.

ðŸ”§ Example use cases:

Storing raw data for analytics

Hosting files for machine learning

Serving images/documents to web apps

### 2. Azure Logic Apps
What it is:
A low-code integration and automation platform to connect apps, data, and services using workflows.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
Trigger-based execution (e.g., when a file arrives, send email).

Pre-built connectors to Office 365, SQL, Salesforce, Twitter, etc.

Uses a visual designer and can embed custom code or Azure Functions.

ðŸ”§ Example use cases:

Automatically send alerts when data files land in Blob Storage

Post new SharePoint items to Microsoft Teams

Daily email reports of sales from a SQL database

###  3. Azure Data Factory (ADF)
What it is:
A cloud-based ETL/ELT orchestration tool to move, transform, and load data across systems.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
No-code + code-based data pipelines (via GUI or JSON).

Supports on-premise and cloud data sources.

Can run Spark, SQL, or custom Python scripts.

Integrated with Azure Synapse, Databricks, Snowflake, etc.

ðŸ”§ Example use cases:

Pulling data from Oracle DB and transforming it before saving to Blob or Synapse.

Automating daily data refreshes.

Combining multiple CSVs into one Parquet dataset.

###  4. Azure Synapse Analytics
What it is:
A unified data analytics platform that combines data warehousing, big data processing, and data exploration.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
Supports T-SQL queries (dedicated pools) and Spark (serverless pools).

Integrates with Azure Data Lake, Power BI, and ADF.

Can query both structured and unstructured data.

ðŸ”§ Example use cases:

Building enterprise data warehouses.

Analyzing big data using Spark notebooks.

Serving BI dashboards via Power BI.

###  5. Azure Purview (now part of Microsoft Purview)
What it is:
A data governance and data catalog service for discovering, classifying, and managing data across your organization.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
Automatically scans data sources to extract metadata.

Builds a data catalog with lineage, classification (e.g., PII, GDPR tags).

Helps govern access, ensure compliance, and understand data usage.

ðŸ”§ Example use cases:

Finding all tables containing email addresses.

Tracing where a KPI column originates in a Power BI dashboard.

Cataloging and classifying data across Azure, on-prem, and SaaS systems.

###  How They Work Together (End-to-End Pipeline):
Blob Storage: Raw sales data (CSV, JSON, Parquet) is ingested.

Data Factory: Moves and transforms data into a refined format.

Synapse Analytics: Stores data in a warehouse and enables complex queries and dashboards.

Logic Apps: Sends alerts when data fails or completes loading.

Purview: Scans the entire system to catalog and tag sensitive data.




## Microsoft Fabric â€“ Unified Data Analytics Platform
 
A Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering built on top of Azure, 
focused on end-to-end data analytics â€” similar in vision to Databricks Lakehouse or Snowflake.

ðŸ§  Core Capabilities:
Unified platform combining:  
   Data Engineering  
   Data Warehousing  
   Real-time analytics  
   Data Science  
   Business Intelligence (Power BI)  
   OneLake â€“ centralized data lake storage (like Delta Lake or Snowflake)

Native Power BI integration  
Notebook and pipeline authoring (like Azure Synapse or Databricks)  
No-code/low-code experience for analysts and data scientists  

ðŸ“Œ Fabric is targeted at data teams who want to perform analytics, visualization,   
and AI from a unified interface without managing infrastructure.
