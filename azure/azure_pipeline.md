# Chat GPT

Here are three solid ways to coordinate those hourly steps on Azure. Pick the one that best matches your stack and ops style; I also included concrete snippets you can copy-paste.

# Option A (most Azure-native): Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipeline with an hourly trigger

**Flow**

1. ADF triggers hourly and kicks off Task 1
2. ADF waits for the ADLS hour folder to exist & contain files
3. ADF runs Task 2 (load bronze in Snowflake)
4. ADF runs Task 3 (bronze → silver SQL in Snowflake)

**Why this is nice**

* Fully managed orchestration, retries, alerts
* Easy parametric folder/hour handling
* Built-in “wait for files” pattern

## 1) Trigger (hourly, process the *previous* hour)

Schedule the trigger at HH:05 and compute the previous hour path once:

```
year=@{formatDateTime(addHours(utcNow(), -1), 'yyyy')}
month=@{formatDateTime(addHours(utcNow(), -1), 'MM')}
day=@{formatDateTime(addHours(utcNow(), -1), 'dd')}
hour=@{formatDateTime(addHours(utcNow(), -1), 'HH')}
path=@{concat(variables('year'), '/', variables('month'), '/', variables('day'), '/', variables('hour'))}
```

## 2) Task 1 activity

Two common implementations:

**(a) Use Event Hubs Capture (no code):** configure EH Capture → ADLS with partitioning by hour. In the pipeline, *skip* calling a function and just wait for the folder.

**(b) Use your Node.js consumer as an Azure Function:** add an **HTTP** (or **Azure Function**) activity to call your function with the hour to process:

* Method: POST
* Body (example):

```json
{ "targetPath": "@{variables('path')}" }
```

Have the function finish only when the write to `YYYY/MM/DD/HH/` is complete.

## 3) “Wait for files” gate (so Task 2 starts only when Task 1 truly finished)

Pattern: **Until** activity → inside it:

* **Get Metadata** (on `adls://.../<path>/`) to check `childItems`
* **If** `@greater(length(activity('GetMetadataHour').output.childItems), 0)` then break; else **Wait** 60–120s and loop.

(If you use Event Hubs Capture, loop until `.avro` files appear; if your function writes `.jsonl`, wait for those.)

## 4) Task 2: load the hour from ADLS → Snowflake bronze

Two good choices:

**A. COPY INTO (fastest/cheapest at scale)**
Make an **ADF Script activity** with a Snowflake linked service and run:

```sql
-- One-time (outside pipeline) recommended setup:
-- CREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION AZURE_INT ...;
-- CREATE STAGE ext_adls URL='azure://<storage-account>.dfs.core.windows.net/<container>'
--   STORAGE_INTEGRATION=AZURE_INT FILE_FORMAT=(TYPE=JSON STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY=FALSE);

-- Hourly load (pipeline passes the folder path as a parameter :path)
COPY INTO bronze.my_collection
FROM @ext_adls/path=@{activity('SetVars').output.variables.path}
FILE_FORMAT=(TYPE=JSON)
ON_ERROR=CONTINUE;  -- or 'ABORT_STATEMENT' if you prefer strict
```

*Tip:* If you have many logical collections, point each to its own bronze table and run one Script per collection (or a single Script that loops with a stored proc).

**B. ADF “Copy Activity” (GUI)**

* Source: ADLS Gen2, folder = `@{variables('path')}`, wildcard `*.jsonl` (or `*.avro` + mapping step)
* Sink: Snowflake table (bronze), “Copy behavior” = `Merge` or `Append` depending on your idempotency plan
* You can also stage to a Snowflake stage and issue a Script after (A).

**Idempotency tips**

* Load into a **staging** bronze table first; record `METADATA$FILENAME` and skip already-seen files on reruns.
* Or keep a small **processed\_files** table keyed by filename + hour.

## 5) Task 3: bronze → silver (SQL)

Use a second **Script activity** right after the COPY. Examples:

```sql
-- If you use procedures:
CALL silver.sp_upsert_from_bronze_hour(:year, :month, :day, :hour);

-- Or direct MERGE:
MERGE INTO silver.users s
USING (
  SELECT * FROM bronze.users_hour
  WHERE year = :year AND month = :month AND day = :day AND hour = :hour
) b
ON s.id = b.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET ...
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (...columns...) VALUES (...);
```

**Success criteria**
Make the Script activity fail on any SQL error. The pipeline’s natural “fail fast” will prevent partial sequences.

# Option B: Azure Durable Functions (code-first orchestration)

If you prefer staying in Functions:

* **Orchestrator function** (Durable Functions) runs hourly (Timer trigger).
* Activity #1: Run your EventHub→ADLS ingestion (or skip if using Capture).
* Activity #2: Call Snowflake (Node.js or Python connector) to execute `COPY INTO` for that hour.
* Activity #3: Execute your bronze→silver SQL (procedures or MERGE).
* Durable Functions give you **deterministic fan-out/fan-in, retries, and backoff** in code.

**Pros:** single repo, IaC friendly, no ADF to manage
**Cons:** you own all the orchestration code & monitoring

---

# Option C: Split orchestration—ADF for Steps 1–2, Snowflake Tasks for Step 3

* Let ADF ingest & load bronze (Steps 1–2).
* Create a **Snowflake Task** (and optional **Streams**) to incrementally populate silver when bronze changes.
* ADF doesn’t need to call Step 3; Snowflake will run it either:

  * **On schedule** (a few minutes after the hour), or
  * **Chained** off another task that detects new bronze rows.

**Pros:** pushes transformation scheduling into Snowflake; great for incremental CDC using Streams
**Cons:** two orchestrators instead of one

# Minimal working blueprint (ADF)

Below is a compact “happy path” you can replicate right away:

1. **Pipeline variables**: `year, month, day, hour, path` (as shown above).
2. **Set Variables**: compute previous hour.
3. **(Optional)** **Azure Function activity** to run your EH→ADLS job for `@{variables('path')}`.
4. **Until** loop with **Get Metadata** + **Wait** until files exist in that hour folder.
5. **Script activity** (Snowflake): `COPY INTO bronze.* FROM @ext_adls/path=@{variables('path')}`.
6. **Script activity** (Snowflake): `CALL silver.sp_upsert_from_bronze_hour(:year,:month,:day,:hour);`

Add standard ADF goodies:

* Global retry: 2–3 times, exponential backoff
* Alerts on failure (Action Groups)
* Logging to Log Analytics

### Notes & gotchas

* **Event Hubs Capture vs Function consumer:** If Capture satisfies your file format (AVRO/Parquet) and partitioning needs, prefer it—less to maintain. If you require JSONL, enrichment, or custom batching, use your Function/Container app.
* **Time windows:** Always process the *previous* hour (e.g., trigger at 05 past). This avoids partial hours and late arrivals (you can also add a second pass “reconciliation” pipeline for T-1 day).
* **Schema evolution:** Keep bronze as semi-structured (`VARIANT`) with lenient COPY, and evolve silver using explicit casts/COALESCE.
* **Security:** Use **Managed Identity** to read ADLS; use **Snowflake External OAuth** or a Snowflake user with a network policy.
* **Idempotency:** Either MERGE on a deterministic key in bronze, or de-dup by filename.
* **Backfills:** Rerun the same pipeline with parameters (year/month/day/hour) over a range.

# GEMINI


You can coordinate these three tasks by using a single pipeline in **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** or **Azure Synapse Analytics**. An orchestration tool like ADF allows you to chain together different activities and run them sequentially, with built-in dependency management.

Here is a breakdown of how to set up the pipeline for each task.

### **1. Hourly Ingestion from Event Hub to ADLS**

This is a streaming ingestion task, which is not a native function of a standard ADF Copy Activity. The most robust and common approach is to use a separate service that can handle real-time data, and then trigger it from ADF.

* **ADF Activity:** **Databricks Notebook Activity**.
* **Implementation:** You will create an Azure Databricks notebook that uses a Spark Structured Streaming job. This job will read from your Event Hub and write the data in Parquet or Delta format to the ADLS folder path, using dynamic variables for the hourly folder structure (e.g., `/YYYY/MM/DD/HH`).
* **ADF Setup:** In your ADF pipeline, add a `Databricks Notebook` activity. Configure it to point to your Databricks workspace and the notebook you created. You can pass the current hour's path dynamically using ADF's built-in system variables: `@{formatDateTime(pipeline().TriggerTime, 'yyyy/MM/dd/HH')}`.

### **2. Load Data from ADLS to Snowflake Bronze Layer**

This is a classic Extract-Load (EL) task that ADF is perfect for.

* **ADF Activity:** **Copy Activity**.
* **Implementation:** Create a Copy Activity in your ADF pipeline.
    * **Source:** The source dataset will be Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). The file path will be the same dynamic path used in the first step: `@activity('Databricks Activity Name').output.output_path`. This ensures the activity reads from the exact folder where the previous step wrote the data.
    * **Sink:** The sink dataset will be Snowflake. You will need to set up a linked service to connect to your Snowflake account.
* **Orchestration:** Connect the `Copy Activity` to the `Databricks Notebook Activity` with a `On success` dependency arrow. This ensures the data loading only begins after the ingestion is complete. 

---

### **3. SQL Transformation in Snowflake (Bronze to Silver)**

This task involves running a SQL command, and ADF can execute this command directly on your Snowflake instance.

* **ADF Activity:** **Snowflake Stored Procedure Activity** or a generic **Script Activity**.
* **Implementation:**
    * The `Snowflake Stored Procedure` activity is ideal if you want to encapsulate the transformation logic in a reusable procedure within Snowflake. The activity would simply call this procedure.
    * Alternatively, the `Script Activity` can be configured to run a single SQL command.
    * In both cases, you will use the Snowflake linked service you created in the previous step.
* **Orchestration:** Connect this final activity to the `Copy Activity` with a `On success` dependency. This guarantees the Bronze-to-Silver transformation only runs after the data has been successfully loaded into the Bronze layer.

By chaining these three activities together in a single ADF pipeline with success dependencies, you create a fully automated, scheduled, and auditable process that can be monitored from a single interface.
