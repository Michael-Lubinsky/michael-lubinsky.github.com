I’m happy to share that I’ve obtained a new certification: AWS Certified Data Engineer – Associate from Amazon Web Services (AWS)!

I worked with a wide range of AWS services throughout this journey, covering everything from data ingestion, transformation, storage, orchestration, to security and monitoring.
Some of the key services I got hands-on with include:

Analytics & Processing:
 Athena for interactive querying, EMR for big data processing with Spark, AWS Glue and Glue DataBrew for ETL and data prep, Redshift for warehousing, Kinesis (both Data Streams and Firehose) and Amazon MSK for streaming data, OpenSearch for search & analytics, and QuickSight for easy data visualization.

Orchestration & Workflow Automation:
 Step Functions, EventBridge, Amazon MWAA (Managed Apache Airflow), and even Lambda triggers to build robust, event-driven pipelines.

Storage & Data Lakes:
 Amazon S3 for scalable storage (with lifecycle policies), S3 Glacier for archiving, EFS and EBS for persistent volumes, and AWS Lake Formation to build and secure data lakes.

Databases:
 RDS and Redshift for relational workloads, DynamoDB for NoSQL, Amazon Keyspaces (Cassandra), DocumentDB (MongoDB-compatible), and even Neptune and MemoryDB for graph and in-memory DB needs.

Compute & Containers:
 Lambda for serverless computing, EC2 for managed compute, ECS and EKS for container orchestration, and AWS SAM for deploying serverless apps.

 Developer Tools & Infrastructure as Code:
 CloudFormation, CDK, CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline helped me practice CI/CD and infrastructure automation.

 Monitoring, Security, and Governance:
 CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and AWS Config for visibility and auditing, IAM for access control, Secrets Manager for credential storage, Macie for PII detection, and KMS for encryption.

 Migration & Integration:
 I also explored AWS DMS and SCT for data migration, Transfer Family and DataSync for moving data in and out of AWS, and AppFlow for SaaS integrations.

 Looking forward to applying all this knowledge in upcoming projects and continuing to build impactful data solutions on AWS!
