Here’s a **POC Plan for Migrating from Managed Azure Postgres to Snowflake**, tailored for your scenario. It’s structured in phases so that you can validate feasibility, measure performance, and evaluate cost/benefit trade-offs before committing to a full migration.

---

## 1. Define Scope & Success Criteria

* **Business Scope**

  * Which schemas, tables, and workloads from Azure Postgres will be tested? (e.g., `bronze/silver/gold` layers, reporting tables, IoT telemetry).
  * Which queries or pipelines are in scope (analytical queries, aggregates, dashboards, ETL jobs)?
* **Success Metrics**

  * Query performance improvement (e.g., 3x faster).
  * Load throughput (GB/hr or rows/sec).
  * Cost per TB stored/queried.
  * Data freshness (near-real-time vs batch).
  * Functional correctness (row counts, aggregates match).

---

## 2. Data Migration Path

* **Inventory & Mapping**

  * Catalog source Postgres tables: datatypes, PK/FK, indexes, constraints.
  * Map Postgres datatypes to Snowflake equivalents (watch out for `timestamptz`, JSON, arrays).
* **Extraction**

  * Use one of:

    * Azure Data Factory (ADF) Copy Data tool.
    * Azure Data Lake staging (`COPY INTO` from external stage).
    * DMS (Database Migration Service) for initial load.
* **Load to Snowflake**

  * Create external stage pointing to ADLS Gen2.
  * Export Postgres tables into Parquet/CSV/Avro in ADLS.
  * Run `COPY INTO` into Snowflake staging/bronze tables.
* **Incremental Loads**

  * Capture changes via:

    * Postgres WAL → Event Hub → ADLS → Snowflake.
    * Or timestamp/sequence columns + scheduled loads.
  * Validate CDC approach for production migration.

---

## 3. Schema & Transformation Validation

* **Schema Checks**

  * Validate column types, nullability, constraints.
* **Row Count Validation**

  * Compare `COUNT(*)` between Postgres and Snowflake.
* **Data Quality**

  * Spot-check aggregates (SUM, AVG, MIN/MAX).
  * Validate time zone correctness for `timestamptz`.
* **Transformation Layer**

  * Replicate Postgres transformations (views, stored procedures) into Snowflake SQL / tasks.

---

## 4. Performance Evaluation

* **Baseline in Postgres**

  * Collect query plans and runtime for representative queries (dashboards, aggregations, joins).
* **Snowflake Test**

  * Run identical queries on migrated data.
  * Capture performance across warehouses (S, M, L).
* **Compare**

  * Runtime, concurrency, scaling.
  * Cost (credits consumed vs Azure Postgres compute).

---

## 5. Workload Simulation

* **Batch ETL**

  * Test ingestion window (e.g., hourly/15-min load).
* **Analytical Queries**

  * Run complex joins, `date_trunc`, window functions, JSON queries.
* **Concurrency**

  * Simulate multiple BI users / dashboard refreshes.
* **Scaling**

  * Test warehouse auto-scale, multi-cluster.

---

## 6. Security & Governance

* **Access Control**

  * Map Postgres roles to Snowflake RBAC (databases, schemas, roles).
* **Data Masking/Tagging**

  * Test Snowflake features (row access policies, masking policies).
* **Integration**

  * Validate authentication (Azure AD / SSO).
  * Logging/monitoring with Snowflake’s Information Schema and Azure Monitor.

---

## 7. Cost & TCO Evaluation

* **Storage Costs**

  * Compare Postgres storage vs Snowflake compressed columnar storage.
* **Compute Costs**

  * Estimate warehouse credit usage for workloads.
* **Operational Costs**

  * Evaluate savings on tuning (indexes, vacuum, partitioning).
  * Evaluate pipeline simplification (Snowpipe vs pg\_cron jobs).

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

* **Datatype Mismatch** → Perform datatype validation early.
* **CDC Latency** → Ensure Event Hub/Snowpipe is tuned.
* **Performance Variability** → Test across multiple warehouse sizes.
* **Cost Spikes** → Implement resource monitors during POC.

---

## 9. Deliverables

* Migration runbook (steps, tools, configs).
* Benchmark report (Postgres vs Snowflake runtimes, cost).
* Data validation results.
* Security & compliance checklist.
* Go/No-Go recommendation for full migration.
