##  `pgvector` to Find Customers with Similar Patterns in PostgreSQL

`pgvector` is a PostgreSQL extension for storing and querying **vector embeddings**. 

Let use it for finding customers with similar patterns.

###   Step 1: Install `pgvector` extension

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```


###  Step 2: Prepare your data

Assume a simplified table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  age INT,
  income FLOAT,
  is_active BOOLEAN,
  gender TEXT,
  -- Add more columns as needed
  embedding VECTOR(10)  -- You‚Äôll store numeric vector here
);
```

### Step 3: Convert raw features to a vector

You'll need to **encode** all features into a fixed-length numeric vector.  
This is usually done in Python:

```python
import psycopg2
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler

# Example: transform features for 1 customer
numeric = [age, income]
binary = [int(is_active)]
categorical = onehot_encoder.transform([[gender]])  # returns one-hot encoded array

embedding = np.concatenate([numeric, binary, categorical], axis=0)
```

Then write this vector to PostgreSQL using psycopg2:

```python
vector_str = '[' + ','.join(map(str, embedding)) + ']'
cursor.execute(
    "UPDATE customers SET embedding = %s WHERE customer_id = %s",
    (vector_str, customer_id)
)
```

###  Step 4: Query for similar customers

Use `pgvector`'s distance functions:

```sql
-- Find top 5 most similar customers to customer #123
SELECT customer_id,
embedding <->
(SELECT embedding FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 123) AS distance
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id != 123
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 5;
```

In PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension,   
the `<->` operator is used to compute the **Euclidean distance** between two vectors.  
You can also use:

| Operator | Distance Function                        |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `<->`    | Euclidean                                |
| `<#>`    | Inner product (negative cosine sim)      |
| `<=>`    | Cosine distance                          |

 

 Feature Encoding Tips

| Data Type     | Encoding Strategy        |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Numeric       | StandardScaler (z-score) |
| Boolean       | 0/1                      |
| Categorical   | One-hot encoding         |
| Text/Freeform | Embeddings (e.g., BERT)  |

## 3. üîç Use Case Scenarios

- Find customers with **similar buying profiles**
- Detect **lookalike audiences** for marketing
- Group **churn risk** customers by pattern similarity
- Power **recommendation engines** (e.g., similar users)

 ## üß© How to Cluster Customers Using pgvector in PostgreSQL

pgvector itself is designed for **similarity search**, not clustering. However, you can still use its tools‚Äîespecially **IVFFlat indexing**‚Äîto support clustering-like workflows. Here are several approaches:

---

### 1. Approximate ‚ÄúClustering‚Äù via IVFFlat Index

- The IVFFlat index uses **k-means** to partition vectors into `lists` (clusters) during index creation.
- These partitions act like pre-computed centroids.
- You can query which list a customer's embedding falls into:

-- Step 1: create IVFFlat index (e.g., 100 lists)
CREATE INDEX ON customers USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);

-- Step 2: find top-1 nearest neighbor centroid for each embedding
-- (uses the internal partition id, if accessible via pgvector metadata or by manual clustering)

This gets you an approximate cluster assignment on insert. But pgvector doesn't expose the centroid IDs directly, so this method is limited.

---

### 2. True Clustering with PL/Python + scikit-learn

Use PL/Python inside PostgreSQL to run real clustering:

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS plpython3u;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cluster_customers(k INT)
RETURNS TABLE(customer_id INT, cluster INT) AS $$
  import plpy
  from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
  rows = plpy.execute("SELECT customer_id, embedding FROM customers")
  ids = [r['customer_id'] for r in rows]
  vecs = [r['embedding'] for r in rows]
  model = KMeans(n_clusters=k).fit(vecs)
  for cid, lbl in zip(ids, model.labels_):
    plpy.execute(f"UPDATE customers SET cluster = {lbl} WHERE customer_id = {cid}")
  return plpy.execute("SELECT customer_id, cluster FROM customers")
$$ LANGUAGE plpython3u;

This stores cluster labels directly in the table.

---

### 3. Extract Embeddings and Cluster Externally

1. Export embeddings to Python.
2. Run `sklearn.cluster.KMeans` or other clustering (`DBSCAN`, `HDBSCAN`).
3. Store cluster labels back in PostgreSQL.

This is often the most flexible and scalable route.

| External clustering workflow     | Full flexibility, scale, variant algos | ETL overhead between DB and Python          |

### üîé Use Case Guide

- Fast approximate segmentation? ‚Üí Use IVFFlat index & store partition IDs.
- Need reliable cluster assignments? ‚Üí Use PL/Python or external clustering.
- Advanced clustering (e.g., DBSCAN/PT us)? ‚Üí Do external scripts and update DB.
