## üîß Requirements Summary:

-   **Input**: 100M clickstream events/day (~1.2K/sec).
    
-   **Data**: Each event has `timestamp, user_id, url, device_id`.
    
-   **Joins**: With user DB (50M), URL DB, device DB (50M).
    
-   **Latency**: Max 5 minutes from ingestion to ETL output.
    

* * *

## ‚úÖ Recommended Architecture Overview:

### 1\. **Ingestion Layer**

-   **Tool**: [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) (or Amazon Kinesis / Google Pub/Sub)
    
-   **Why**: Kafka is highly scalable and supports real-time ingestion with partitioned topics.
    

 

`Clickstream Events ‚Üí Kafka Topic ("clickstream")`

* * *

### 2\. **Streaming ETL Layer**

-   **Tool**: Apache Flink / Apache Spark Structured Streaming / Google Dataflow
    
-   **Why**: These engines support real-time joins, stateful processing, and windowing.

#### Joins:

-   Use **broadcast joins** (if dimension tables can fit in memory) or **stateful stream-table joins**.
    

##### Strategies:

-   Load dimension data (user, device, url) into:
    
    -   **In-memory broadcast** (Spark/Flink side input)
        
    -   **External lookup** (Redis / RocksDB state backend / Preloaded in Flink state)
        

##### Example in Spark:

```

`# Load dimension data periodically users_
df = spark.read.format("jdbc").load(...)
# or Delta Lake
devices_df = ...
urls_df = ...

# Stream clickstream
clicks_stream = spark.readStream.format("kafka").load(...)

# Join stream with static/broadcasted dims
enriched_stream = clicks_stream \
    .join(broadcast(users_df), "user_id") \
    .join(broadcast(devices_df), "device_id") \
    .join(broadcast(urls_df), "url")`
```
* * *

### 3\. **Serving Layer**

-   **Sink**:
    
    -   Real-time: Apache Hudi / Delta Lake on S3/HDFS
        
    -   Low-latency queries: Apache Druid / ClickHouse / BigQuery
        

`Processed Stream ‚Üí Delta Lake / ClickHouse`

-   Use **partitioning** on date/hour/user\_id for fast reads/writes.
    

* * *

### 4\. **Orchestration & Monitoring**

-   **Tools**: Apache Airflow (batch ops), Prometheus + Grafana (metrics), Apache Superset (BI)
    
-   Ensure metrics on lag, throughput, and errors are continuously tracked.

## üß† Optimizations for Latency & Scalability

Aspect

Recommendation

**Dimension tables**

Use in-memory broadcast (if small), or cache in Redis / state store (Flink)

**Backpressure**

Monitor Kafka consumer lag; auto scale streaming jobs

**Fault tolerance**

Enable checkpointing (e.g., Spark checkpoint or Flink RocksDB backend)

**Throughput tuning**

Partition Kafka topics (e.g., 12‚Äì24), set parallelism accordingly

**Schema evolution**

Use Avro or Protobuf with Schema Registry

* * *  NiFi

**Apache NiFi** is a powerful tool for **data flow automation**, especially in **data ingestion, transformation, and routing**, but it has some limitations for your specific **low-latency, high-throughput clickstream pipeline**:

* * *

### ‚ùå Reasons NiFi May Not Be Ideal for Your Case:

#### 1\. **Streaming at Scale Limitations**

-   NiFi is **not optimized for continuous high-throughput streaming analytics**.
    
-   Your workload (100M events/day ‚âà 1.2K/sec) with **stateful joins** and <5 min latency is better handled by a **stream processing engine** like **Spark Streaming** or **Apache Flink**.
    

#### 2\. **Joins and State Management**

-   NiFi does not natively support complex **stream-table joins** or **stateful processing** like Flink/Spark.
    
-   Workarounds (e.g., ExecuteScript, LookupRecord, or custom processors) are **cumbersome** and not scalable when joining against 50M-record dimension tables.
    

#### 3\. **Limited Backpressure Handling**

-   NiFi has **limited flow control** when compared to event-driven systems like Kafka + Flink/Spark, which offer **fine-grained backpressure** and **exactly-once** semantics.
    

#### 4\. **Operational Overhead**

-   Scaling NiFi clusters is more manual and **resource-intensive** compared to Spark or Flink clusters with **auto-scaling, parallelism tuning**, and **dynamic partitioning**.
    

#### 5\. **Latency Expectations**

-   Achieving **consistent <5 minute latency** with joins in NiFi is difficult without relying on external processing tools, defeating the purpose of using NiFi alone.
    

* * *

### ‚úÖ When NiFi Is a Good Fit:

-   **Data ingestion and routing** (e.g., moving logs, CSVs, JSON, from source to target)
    
-   **ETL batch jobs** that don‚Äôt require complex joins or sub-5-minute latencies
    
-   **Prototyping** or **low-volume flows** with minimal transformation
